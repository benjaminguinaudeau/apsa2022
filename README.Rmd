If you are tired of scrolling through the [APSA program](https://convention2.allacademic.com/one/apsa/apsa22/index.php) or waiting for the page to load, this repo is for you. 

This repo only contains one folder with the program in tabular format (csv and xlsx). You can download it and enjoy your APSA experience!

More data has been collected (parsed authors and universities ; abstract). I do not need it for now, but if you are interested in this kind of data, feel free to get in touch.
