The panel aims at discussing these changes in light of the parliamentary and presidential elections that will take place in April and June 2022. First, recent and ongoing changes in the party system will be studied with a joint focus on new parties and their institutionalization, including Emmanuel Macron’s La République en marche, that successfully erupted onto the political scene in 2017; and older parties that face direct challenges, like the radical right Rassemblement national and challenger Eric Zemmour.

However, the public sphere does not arise ex nihilo, it is created, sustained, and shaped by political acts and discourse. A curious case of co-causality thus arises: how do actors shape the public sphere which in turn shapes their actions? The five papers on this panel help shed light on that question and discuss how the concept of political life was first developed in ancient Greece and Rome, including the ideals and contested notions of justice it raised, the practices underpinning public debate, and the private ambitions to which public politics gave rise. Turning to Plato, Aristotle, Plutarch, and Cicero, the presenters explore not only the contours and content of the political sphere in the past, but also how ancient ideas about public life were then taken up and transformed by later thinkers in the medieval and modern eras. Through reflecting on antiquity, the presenters will illuminate new possibilities for the ethics of discourse and ambit of political action as we seek to shape and re-shape the politics of the new, uncertain, post-pandemic reality.","Mark J.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 1: Political Thought and Philosophy,,September 15,am,8:00,9:30,Representing Class Politics in Socialist Thought,"Pandemic politics has often seemed to harbor transformative potential. The largest mass demonstrations in US history against racist state violence, the highest level of labor activism in forty years, the emergence of viable socialist electoral politics in the US and the UK, and the return of large-scale social welfare spending after decades of neoliberal austerity all seemed to portend the return of mass movements as catalysts of social reform. Yet the current moment also seems mired in the political deadlocks of the recent past. While there has been widespread popular mobilization and disaffection, such energies have not yet been translated into forms of organization that could sustain and propel them toward radical change. Events dominating the headlines during the pandemic – the George Floyd rebellion, Striketober, the Great Resignation – all seem to point toward a renewed class politics. Yet the political leadership and independent organization that might move us in that direction have not yet materialized, too often leaving working-class politics ventriloquized by others.
In response to this situation, this panel re-engages the history of socialist thought to rethink the role of class politics in repairing and expanding the frayed social fabric of our democracies. For some contemporary political theorists, transformative class politics is a relic of the past. Predicating society’s democratic transformation on workers’ organization and empowerment may have made sense during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but today, the working class does not seem to occupy a comparably powerful socioeconomic position, nor, in turn, does it confront capitalist society with the emancipatory aspirations of the past.
By bringing class politics back into democratic theory’s growing engagement with socialist thought, this panel seeks to focus on one of its most neglected (but, we argue, most vital) dimensions: representation. “The working class,” we suggest, is not merely an economic or demographic category, but a political construct that can only take its place at the heart of public life through organization and struggle. Thinking about class representation also means acknowledging the complexity of “the proletariat” as a constructed category. The socialist thinkers we discuss on this panel were attentive to the multifaceted experiences of working people, and they understood class as a political orientation shaped by social identities, from gender to race and ethnicity. Our goal in engaging their thought now is to understand how an inclusive and transformative working-class identity can be forged through institutions of self-representation, so that our crises might be resolved by and for the popular majority.
Our panel investigates concrete forms of workers’ democratic self-representation: how unions, councils, cooperatives, and political parties re-shape the consciousness and the identities of organized workers. We begin with the idea of a unified working class as a political agent of emancipatory social transformation as it first emerged historically in the Working Men’s Party of late-1820s Philadelphia. Then, we explore how advocates of revolutionary industrial unionism in the early 20th century US presented working class rule as a project of mass cooperation, prefigured by a distinctive strategy of union organization and socialist praxis. Next, we interrogate the epochal rift in the workers’ movement during the transition from the Second to the Third International, reading polemical texts from this period to illuminate the dilemmas of constructing an ideal of ‘the proletariat’ as model democratic agent, with competing conceptions of class, party, parliament, and workers’ council. We conclude by turning to W.E.B. Du Bois’s theory of “race organization.” Against the common socialist view that forging class politics requires transcending race, Du Bois argues that ending racism and capitalism requires preserving and cultivating race through race-based political, economic, educational, and religious organizations. We consider the argument for race as a necessary category for self-representation within socialist movements.",Paul A.

Yet, questions remain how leaders’ ability to mobilize individuals varies over different activities, the conditions under which different leaders are most effective, and the mechanisms that underpin their authority. To answer these questions, this panel brings together researchers conducting cutting edge research on political participation and leadership. The papers discuss the role of different leaders in mobilizing individuals to become politically active, i.e., to campaign for political candidates (Jöst and Lust), to support democracy and local government reforms (Baldwin; Mourad), and to engage in more risky activities in the Philippine “Drug War” (Brooke and Buckley). Moreover, in doing so, they draw on rich empirical evidence from Asia, the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa gathered using both quantitative and qualitative methods, including survey and experimental methods. Specifically: Brooke and Buckley use an original survey with Catholic priests and lay leaders to investigate when and why religious leaders actively mobilize their community to protect targeted individuals from state violence during Rodrigo Duterte’s “Drug War’’ in the Philippines. Baldwin also focuses on religious leaders’ ability to mobilize. Drawing on rich experimental evidence from Tanzania and Zambia, she finds that religious leaders’ public statements can effectively mobilize citizens to support democracy in contexts where religious cleavages are not salient, but they do not appear able to mobilize individuals to support economic policy change in contexts where such cleavages exist. Jöst and Lust also employ data from a survey experiment conducted in Zambia to compare how and why different types of local leaders can mobilize individuals to engage in campaigns and community meetings. They find that Zambians are significantly more likely to participate when they are asked to do so by more socially influential and central local leaders, and that these leaders gain compliance, at least in part, due to their ability to monitor citizens and sanction non-compliance. Finally, Mourad draws on extensive fieldwork in Lebanon to examine the role of local elites in international aid distribution in response to the Syrian refugee influx in Lebanon. She explores dynamics of strategic interactions among local elites and international donors and provides a new framework to understand how local leaders act to benefit their communities. Taken together, these contributions add important insights to an emerging literature that explores the role of local authorities in mobilizing citizens to engage in political actions.",Ellen M.

The current wave of populism, nationalism, democratic backsliding, and ethnocentrism has swept away talk of the end of history, sparking renewed debate about the sustainability and likely future of interstate cooperation. Yet, existing work tells us little about how citizens’ opinions shape and constrain policy decisions around international cooperation. This panel aims to disentangle how the public forms views of international cooperation and whether such views shape the decisions made by policymakers in an array of issue areas. Casler et al. explore whether the public holds leaders accountable for “soft” commitments, such as the voluntary pledges states make through the Paris Agreement. Brutger and Pond examine public opinion of anti-trust policies, finding that citizens prefer such regulations apply to foreign rather than domestic firms. Egel probes support for interstate cooperation to ban explosive weapons, showing how citizens differentially assess cooperation with states that either shame or praise their country.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 19: International Security,,September 15,am,8:00,9:30,International Politics of the Arms Trade,"This panel investigates the international politics of the arms trade, seeking to understand states' choices about weapons production, purchases, and sales: what to buy, whom to buy from or work with, and whose interests - governments, firms, and/or other non-state actors - are represented in these decisions. Few states are capable of meeting their need for military capabilities autarkically, and even states that could may find it beneficial to purchase some weapons abroad. The global arms trade thus is neither purely market-driven nor purely diplomacy-driven; rather, weapons sales implicate traditional diplomatic and military concerns, such as relative power and alliance formation or maintenance, while also responding to economic concerns, such as the marginal costs of production and firms' pursuit of profit.
Panelists use a variety of methods and draw on historical evidence ranging from the 1860s to the present to generate important conceptual, theoretical, and empirical advances. Caverley advances a production function of military capability, which suggests that the marginal costs of producing high-end weapons leads to a winnowing of potential suppliers. Gannon presents a new dataset focused on the economic resources states could use to produce military capabilities. Spindel examines how states use weapons purchases to garner additional benefits from supplying countries, such as infrastructure investments or guaranteed access to educational opportunities. Finally, Wueger conceptualizes arms deals as processes rather than as discrete events to investigate the circumstances under which states choose to buy or sell weapons secretly.

This panel reinvigorates and advances the study of how bureaucratic interests and organizational processes shape contemporary foreign policy and international security. Across different periods and contexts, the panel explores three broad questions: (1) When are political leaders likely to defer to the preferences of the security bureaucracy; (2) How do security bureaucracies respond to geopolitical or technological changes in the international environment; and (3) when do the incentive structures of and within security organizations lead to behavior out of synch with national interest?

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 2: Foundations of Political Theory,,September 15,am,8:00,9:30,The Politics of Violence,"This panel interrogates the relationship between politics and violence through the lens of the history of political thought, comparative political theory, and feminist theory. From the Hobbesian monarchy and Baconian “violent motion” to systems of colonialism, racism, and sexism, each paper interrogates the circumstances that drive political actors to resort to violence. Our papers ask: What is violence? How should citizens respond to the violence the state uses against them? Is the use of violence ever justifiable, particularly for the purposes of self-defense? Can violence committed by the oppressed function as a critique of systems of domination, or does such violence merely perpetuate the same problems it seeks to counteract? What toll does violence take on those who wield it? And who gets to count as a theorist of violence? How do “geographies of violence,” in Murad Idris’ words, determine who can speak legibly about violence, in the first place? The panel will thus stage a conversation across approaches to political theory, with papers sharing a broadly critical sensibility about violence as a concept fundamental to the discipline and the field.
Contextualizing Thomas Hobbes’ work in the broader debates of his time, Rosie Wagner examines Hobbes’ argument for the right to self-defense as a justification for resisting arrest to explore the ambiguities inherent to social contract theory. Murad Idris responds to the suturing together of Islamism and violence through the concept of jihad by American philosophers, and re-centers Islamic thinkers as themselves theorists of colonial and capitalist violence. In a reading of Toni Morrison’s Beloved, Rose Owen shows that Sethe’s filicide is an act of violence that resists the sexual dispossession of slave women and yet leaves Sethe haunted, exposing the limits of the feminist uses of violence. Finally, Samuel Zeitlin draws on Francis Bacon’s work to conceptualize “violent motion,” and questions whether Bacon’s account naturalizes the presence of violence in political life.",Yves Winter McGill University,Matthew Shafer Florida International University,"Resisting Arrest and the Right to Fight for Your Life - Rosemarie Elias Wagner, Harvard University

Decades of social science shows the church is a central location for political socialization and civic engagement. Churches provide resources for congregants to learn about candidates and issues, register to vote, and mobilize in pursuit of specific policy interests. Churches are largely segregated in the United States, so political socialization happening in these spaces falls along racial lines. This panel will further our understanding of religion as a racialized experience and the role of religion in the formation of racial and political attitudes. As such, the work presented speaks to a wide range of existing literature in religion and politics, racial/ethnic politics, public opinion, and political communication. Leveraging qualitative and quantitative analyses, the authors examine Christians from multiple racial groups and their respective church contexts, at both the clergy and congregant perspective.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 44: Democracy and Autocracy,,September 15,am,8:00,9:30,Making and Breaking Elections,"This panel examines the microfoundations of electoral integrity in the Global South. The broad goal of the panel lies in bridging a divide in the study of electoral integrity. On the one hand, scholars of electoral integrity often focus on big concept theoretical ideas measured at the national level. On the other hand, the locus of electoral integrity often lies in how participants in an election judge the quality of specific local electoral processes. This panel seeks to reconcile this disconnect by bringing together three empirical papers that focus on how the personnel in a polling station – election monitors and poll workers – shape the nature of election results. Mollie Cohen’s paper draws on Peru’s 2018 gubernatorial elections to assess how the presence of (as-if randomly assigned) partisan observers changes election outcomes. Raul Duarte’s paper (with Andres Carrizosa and Jose Tomas Sanchez) examines a similar question in Paraguay’s 2018 elections, using administrative policies regarding how voters are assigned to polling booths to estimate the effect of partisan poll monitors, also comparing the de jure and the de facto allocation of partisan poll monitors. In the third empirical study, Tesalia Rizzo (with F. Daniel Hidalgo) uses a novel dataset to consider how the partisan preferences of poll workers employed by the electoral commission shapes local election outcomes. The final paper (by Michelle Brown, J. Andrew Harris, and Zach Warner) links the kinds of empirical evidence in these three papers to establish the central importance of contextually-informed, empirically sophisticated work in understanding the presence and nature of local electoral integrity. Using recent examples from “the loser’s playbook” – strategies that losers of elections use to undermine electoral integrity – they develop a theoretical framework for understanding how perceptions of electoral integrity can become an important political tool for electoral losers, and suggest how political science research can inform – or misinform – such debates.",J.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 48: Health Politics & Health Policy,,September 15,am,8:00,9:30,Health and Populism in the U.S. and Europe,"The enduring political importance of Trumpism, the Brexit vote and its tumultuous aftermath in the United Kingdom, and the growing electoral support for populist and authoritarian parties in Europe earmark a new populist phase of politics. In parallel, starting well before the Covid-19 pandemic, several regions in the U.S. and Europe have been showing worsening health indicators, such as mental health problems, suicides, and a return of diseases of poverty. Regions with heavy industrial legacies that experienced a decline in manufacturing employment are particularly prone to multifaceted health problems, which in turn might increase the support for populist parties. The health of people and the health of democracy are intertwined. People left behind in regions struck by diseases of despair, and workers facing precarity and the prospect of downward mobility, have a higher tendency to support populist insurgents. Trump’s popularity in health-deprived regions of the U.S., the high share of Brexit votes in the unhealthiest towns in the U.K. hit by years of austerity are cases in point.
Increasingly, populist parties gain enough support to form governments in the U.S. and Europe alike. Populism, a mode of political leadership that tries to build direct connections to non-elites and use them against elites, can have a range of valences. Sometimes it propels redistributive agendas that help dislodge entrenched privileges. At other times it promotes reactionary, regressive agendas, in which the “people” whose interests it claims to represent are a circumscribed subset of society, and the attack on “elites” carefully avoids threatening economic privilege and instead reinforces it. In the second case, political strongmen promising a better life to their voters and “taking back control” only exploit disillusioned people left behind by globalization and deindustrialization. Once in power, populists often discriminate against precarious communities, divert resources away from universal public services, and question the role of expertise, thus potentially aggravating health problems.
Does health vulnerability catalyze populism? Once elected to government positions, how do populists affect citizens’ health? The Covid-19 pandemic has made these questions all the more relevant, propelling the health-populism nexus to the center of academic debates. With all the difficulties and suffering that the pandemic has created, it also represents an opportunity to refocus populism studies with a more explicit focus on health. Health is emerging as a fundamental dividing line, polarizing citizens in novel and unforeseen ways. To address these challenges, the panel brings together a diverse group of early-career scholars from the U.S. and Europe, offering a truly interdisciplinarity outlook, spanning the fields of public health, sociology, and political science. The papers explore the effect of populist governance on health, health vulnerability, and support for populism, and the effect of ill health and competition for public health resources on anti-immigration attitudes. The health-populism nexus is a crucial but neglected topic that fits the general theme of this year’s APSA conference, helping to prepare the disciple for the post-pandemic era.","Kurt Weyland University of Texas, Austin",Scott L.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 52: Migration & Citizenship,,September 15,am,8:00,9:30,"Migration Management and Its Discontent: Human Rights, Informality and Smuggling","Since recent increases in international migration, and especially irregular migrations, wealthy states have stepped up policies to close borders and control migration. While access to destinations in the Global North is increasingly harder, the demand for migration from the Global South has remained steady. As a result, an informal smuggling economy arose to circumvent the border closures. In response, states criminalize the act of smuggling. For example, the European Union has increasingly tied development aid to the requirement that the states receiving the aid also use a security approach to migration and criminalize smuggling. This panel explores this interplay between state policies and social responses, such as the smuggling industry, and how these affect migrant rights, state – society relations, and relations between states. The first paper from Micinski et al. outlines recent developments in migration management and how states in the Global North are increasingly leveraging development aid as a means of migration control in the Global South. Yet, this kind of migration management aid, they note, creates unintended negative consequences and perverse incentives that strengthen authoritarian institutions without interdicting migration. The second paper, Chwalisz’s contribution, makes the case that human smuggling is increasingly at the crossroads in political science questions of state-to-state, and state-to-society relations. She explores the political importance both domestically and internationally of how states are responding to the illicit industry of human smuggling. Yet, political scientists have often ceded the study of illicit economies in general and human smuggling to criminologists, sociologists, and anthropologists. Chwalisz showcases how human smuggling can illuminate some of the current political science debates and how political scientists in turn are uniquely positioned to contribute to the study of human smuggling, both on the theoretical and methodological front. The third paper, Frowd’s contribution, exemplifies how the tension between state policies and human smuggling is changing state-society relations. He examines the interplay between migration management and human smuggling in one major transit country, Niger. Under EU pressure, the Nigerian government criminalized smuggling in a country, where 'smuggling' practices predate colonization as a means of livelihood and identity. The result is a blurring of the licit and the illicit economy, a process Frowd describes as ‘quasi-legality.’ Finally, Paul’s paper contributes to our understanding of how the pandemic is affecting migration management. She outlines how COVID-19 policies and politics have influenced smuggling and anti-smuggling efforts in the European Union. Paul explores the discourse formation around migration debates, and how politicians at the national and supranational (EU) level have framed debates regarding the mobility and situation of European citizens. She shows us how the kind of actor dominating the discourse affects migrant rights and migrant agency. Together, these four papers outline the interplay between states, migration management, and social responses. They showcase who sets the agenda in conversation and policy making on migration, and the unintended consequences of these policies. The panel shows how human smuggling is a response to restrictive migration management policies that are disconnected from our theoretical understanding of migration and from the lived experiences of migrants. The papers put human smuggling in conversation with the policies that foster it and highlight the unintended externalities of the securitization of migration.",Noora Anwar Lori Boston University,"Nicholas Barnes University of st Andrews

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 6: Political Economy,,September 15,am,8:00,9:30,Settler Colonialism from a Comparative Perspective,"The settler colonial state occupies a central stage in the enduring scholarly interest in colonialism and postcolonial political, legal, and economic institutions. Historical-institutionalist scholars conceive the colonial state as the central conceptual category to understand various colonial legal-administrative and social structures and their postcolonial developmental legacies, which vary from one European colonizer to another. Economic historians also engage the state, albeit indirectly, when they argue why and how, for example, property rights institutions explain variations in long-run development in the modern world. The existing scholarly understanding of the settler state is nonetheless dominated by insights generated through the study of settler institutions in the ""New World"", Australia, and New Zealand. Settler institutions were indeed less prevalent in areas outside these regions that were brought under European colonization at later historical stages, i.e. since the 19 century, and were predominantly ruled through “indirect rule” institutions. However, many countries in East, North and Southern Africa, East Asia under the Japanese, Central Asia under the Soviet Union, and Mandatory Palestine all experienced some form of settler institutions under colonial rule or settler occupation.
This panel aims to draw scholarly attention to these less studied instances by bringing together a wide-range of insights, perspectives, and approaches to the settler state from Africa, Asia, and the Americas. In doing so, we will re-evaluate, build on, and develop social science theories of settler colonialism, state institutions, and their long-run effects on various outcomes of interest. How did settlement affect these countries' institutions today?
The papers on the panel address key theoretical debates and approaches to the settler state across a number of regions in Asia, North America and Africa.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Related Groups / Environmental Politics and Theory,,September 15,am,8:00,9:30,Viral Politics,"Covid-19 pandemic has in many ways, some quite traumatic, upended the modes of life we’ve become accustomed to: ranging from proximity to others and personal touch, work-life and leisure, procurement of food and necessities, interpersonal relationships and sharing of public spaces, to the actual lives of loved ones that were and will be lost.
Australian environmental philosopher Thom van Dooren argues that losing a form of life in these ways prompts mourning – a capacity we share with various animal species, such as crows – which is primarily about appropriating a new understanding of the world and ourselves within it. For the avian species van Dooren studies, it is about learning new “flight ways.”
While there are countless lessons to be learned from the pandemic, not all of them are tragic. With a big social change, ossified imaginaries and modes of conduct are disrupted, their inevitability made contestable. Opportunity to reimagine and reorganize our collective lives – to find new “flight ways” – arose.
This panel brings together a group of political thinkers trying to, as Gilles Deleuze put it, “become worthy of the event” they face, by working to understand the world anew and reorient themselves towards it. The four papers comprising the panel are meditations on the different senses in which we can call the Covid-19 pandemic a political event and politics a viral activity.
The first paper – “Free to Pollute, Free to Infect: Political Anxiety as Worlds End” – by Prof. Cara Daggett, explores the deep history of the Western notion of freedom and the ways in which this potent concept has been mobilized by elites’ fear of dependency and relationality, and deployed against various challenges to the hierarchical, extractive systems they’ve benefited from. The second paper – “Viral Agencies and More-than-Human Politics: A Thought Experiment” – by Prof. Stephanie Erev, studies viral agencies that recast politics as an essentially more-than-human endeavor, through an innovative reading of, on the one hand, two competing models of democratic theory (deliberativism and agonistic pluralism), and on the other, a pregnant notion of “swarming.” The third paper – “Covid-19 Believes in You: Viral World-Making and Creativity of Coded Matter” – by Prof. Jairus Grove, takes a deep-dive into the Covid-19 virus and explores its world-making and creative capacities, capable of altering the course of planetary history by rewriting metabolic and symbolic functions from the inside out. The final paper – “Nietzsche, Foucault, and Covid-19: Two Philosophies of Power and a Pandemic” – by Ph.D. candidate Tvrtko Vrdoljak, makes use of the Covid-19 pandemic to compare and contrast Michael Foucault’s and Friedrich Nietzsche’s respective philosophies of power and their entailing images of politics. It argues Foucault followed Nietzsche’s model of power-relations to an incredible degree of faithfulness, but made a crucial break with his naturalism, thereby transposing Nietzsche’s insights onto a sociocentric framework, with limitations evident in his many analyses of pandemics.","Samantha Frost University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign",William E.

Virtual Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 2: Foundations of Political Theory,,September 15,am,8:00,9:30,Alexis de Tocqueville on Equality and the Democratic Ethos (Virtual Session),"This panel takes up the question of the origins and character of Alexis de Tocqueville’s account of democratic and egalitarian social life. Tocqueville remains one of the most acute observers of both the political and cultural transformations at the heart of the modern, democratic world. In recent years, basic commitments to democratic politics and values have come under attack. In returning to Tocqueville, this panel hopes to uncover the origins, fragility, and strengths of democracy not only as a set of political institutions, but as a deeper form of social equality and equal respect. While the conditions of mass democratic political life have no doubt radically transformed from the world Tocqueville observed in antebellum America, core features of his understanding of the democratic ethos can continue to guide reflection on strengthening and elevating the best of our democratic tradition.
Raul Rodriguez’s paper deals with the important impact of Tocqueville’s encounter with Native Americans in shaping his understanding of the meaning of freedom, independence, and equality. Against much of the prevailing literature on this topic, Rodriguez argues that Tocqueville saw in Native American communities not simply an idealized alternative to the democratic social state, but important features of the kind of justice democracy at its best aspires to facilitate. Luke Foster’s paper takes up a similar question of the origins of Tocqueville’s account of the democratic ethos. Working through the influences of Pascal, Rousseau, and Montesquieu, Foster argues that Tocqueville took seriously Pascal’s account of the restless soul, and sought to imagine distinctively democratic means of educating democratic citizens. Dimitrios Halikias’ paper takes as its point of discussion Tocqueville’s account of the place of servants in democratic society. It reflects on the intense aversion to formal hierarchy that characterizes democratic culture, while reconstructing Tocqueville’s treatment of the way hidden, concealed social hierarchies can reappear throughout the democratic home and workplace.",Cheryl B.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 1: Political Thought and Philosophy,,September 15,am,10:00,11:30,Liberalism in Crisis,"Anxiety about liberalism is in the air. Public intellectuals battle to explain why it should be rescued or why it has failed. The controversy is heated, for liberalism has become, in some accounts, the constitutive ideology of the West. In this context, political theorists and historians of political thought have provided new historical accounts of liberalism that seek to understand why it is in under threat. Flourishing literatures have explored the history of neoliberalism and its relationship to liberalism tout court. The multiplication of histories of (neo)liberalism has triggered a new methodological debate about how to tell the history of liberalism. Review essays have started investigating the meaning of these developments. In short, during a renewed crisis of liberalism, a new chapter in the study of the theory and history of liberalism has opened. This panel brings together political theorists and historians of political thought who are part of this ongoing discussion.
The two first papers concentrate on the early nineteenth century – a period that most scholars now recognize as the birth date of liberalism in Europe. Developing the argument of her latest book, The Lost History of Liberalism. From Ancient Rome to the Twenty-First Century (Princeton, 2018), Helena Rosenblatt’s paper builds on the French liberal writer Germaine de Staël to argue that the kind of liberalism worth restoring today is one that grants a central role to emotions in politics. While also building on her recent monograph, Freedom: an Unruly History (Harvard, 2020), Annelien de Dijn takes a different view on liberalism. In her paper, she argues that the characteristic trait of European liberals since the early nineteenth century has been their hostility towards democracy, before exploring what this means for our contemporary understanding of liberalism.
Joshua Cherniss takes us to twentieth century liberal thought – a period he has explored in his Liberalism in Dark Times: the Liberal Ethos in the Twentieth Century (Princeton, 2021). Challenging the view that liberalism is chiefly about institutions, Cherniss’s paper argues that canonical liberals were equally – if not more – interested in matters of character and conduct. An ethos-based liberalism, he claims, is better able to avert the problems of coercion and uniformity than brands of liberalism traditionally focused on institutions. Last, Arthur Ghins’s paper delves into the methodological debates on the historiography of liberalism that Rosenblatt, de Dijn, and Cherniss have touched upon in their published works. His paper offers a new method of understanding the history of liberalism. On his view, the meta-history of liberalism allows us to understand the current debate about the crisis of liberalism as the latest example of a long-standing practice of rewriting the history of liberalism in the light of a preferred or least favourite conception of liberalism. Gianna Englert, who is currently completing her first monograph on French liberalism, will be chairing the panel, and acting as a commentator.
This panel fits well in this year’s theme “Rethink, Restructure, and Reconnect: Towards a Post-Pandemic Political Science.” The pandemic has put what is often referred to as “the liberal order” under enormous pressure. Critics of liberalism see the current context as an occasion to move beyond liberalism, whereas its advocates envisage it as an opportunity to reimagine it. By going back to the historical sources of liberal thought, this panel will help us to think through the promises and pitfalls of what is now considered the dominating global ideology.",Gianna Englert Southern Methodist University,Gianna Englert Southern Methodist University,"Liberalism and Democracy: A Fraught Relationship - Annelien de Dijn, University of Utrecht

This session uses micro-level evidence from the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Twitter to explore the impacts of globalization on extremism. Extremism may develop organically as a response to changing socio-political conditions, for example as backlash against migrants. Migration may also contribute to the spread of extremism by exposing individuals to new ideas which they transfer to their home communities, or by facilitating the transfer of illicit funds across regions. Extremists enlist decentralized communication technologies like social media to spread ideology and recruit supporters, offering them a global reach. Finally, the global, multifaceted nature of extremism provides individuals with a choice of how, where, and with whom to act. Members of militant extremist organizations switch affiliations frequently and for a variety of reasons, allowing organizations to transform and evolve, and allowing potential extremists to tailor their participation as their needs and goals shift. Collectively, these papers shed light on the way that the modern, globalized world facilitates the development and execution of extremism.",Thomas Pepinsky Cornell University,"Thomas Pepinsky Cornell University

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 12: Comparative Politics of Developing Countries,,September 15,am,10:00,11:30,The Politics of Crises and Resilience in the African Sahel,"This panel examines governance in the context of current security and health crises in two African Sahel countries: Mali and Burkina Faso. The papers explore how political parties and military leaders have strategically responded to these crises in order to maintain their power. They also shed light on the roles of long-standing social institutions in the contemporary context, showing how social clubs have endured and bolstered democratic practices, and historically-rooted self-defense groups have acquired new responsibilities. By examining political party messaging, military leadership, citizen engagement with self-defense groups, and social capital within youth social clubs, these authors draw attention to the diverse set of political dynamics and social actors that impact the nature of the state and democracy in the contemporary Sahel.
Saidou contributes new insight into African political parties and pandemic politics through his study of how political parties integrated COVID into their messaging in Burkina Faso. His careful analysis of partisan electoral campaign emphasizes how parties strategically shift what they communicate to voters in response to crises.
Honig investigates the expanding influence of self-defense groups during Burkina Faso’s recent security crisis. Her approach emphasizes the complex relationships between the state, citizens, and nonstate security providers in fragile and weak state contexts.
Boisvert focuses on the role of the military in governance, demonstrating that, in contrast to narratives depicting military leaders as reformers, military rule has entrenched elite power politics in Mali. His paper highlights the resilience of neo-patrimonial political institutions, even as regimes types have shifted from flawed democracy to military juntas in Mali.
Finally, Bleck’s paper examines a key source of social capital and local public goods provision during Mali’s security crisis: informal social clubs called grinw. By analyzing focus group transcripts from 66 grinw, she shows how and why youths have maintained a critical local institution, despite the disruptions of conflict.
This set of papers contextualizes political processes and actors in two countries with on-going crises. In doing so, they also highlight core issue areas that policymakers attempting to increase responsive governance and stability in the region must consider.",Lauren Honig Boston College,"John F.

They were perceived and treated as a group that needs to be taken care of rather than given full citizenship and political rights and agency. Today disabled people find themselves navigating changing public attitudes and institutions in order to gain access and participation in society and political life as citizens, voters, and representatives. The papers in this panel examine how disabled people, political and social institutions, and society interact with each other. Approaching this common theme from distinct perspectives, they study different subgroups of disabled people (citizens, voters, and candidates; people with different origins and types of impairments) and institutions (elections, the welfare state, and community care). As such, the panel takes a holistic yet differentiated look at the under-researched topic of disability, society, and politics, embodying sub-disciplinary (behaviour, comparative), methodological (interviews, survey research, experiments), and regional diversity (U.S., United Kingdom, Turkey, Belgium). The authors and discussants include established and early career academics from different regions with diverse disability and gender identities.","Elizabeth J.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 16: International Political Economy,,September 15,am,10:00,11:30,"Political Tensions Can Fuel, Not Dampen, Globalization","Governments today are increasingly cross-pressured by citizens’ demands for protection and global firms’ demands to sustain an open economy. How do governments – democratic and authoritarian — address these competing demands in order to stay in office? How do global firms address new political risks arising from protectionist and hostile citizen sentiments toward foreign businesses and products?
Our panel together argues that the dominant IPE scholarship on these questions does not give enough agency to governments and firms in the global economy. The conventional view is that governments and firms respond to the rise of protectionist sentiments by raising barriers to trade, capital and/or immigration (for the government) and by rewiring global supply chains or withdrawing from hostile environments abroad (for global firms). These arguments predict that the rise of citizens’ protectionist sentiments can dampen globalization.
By contrast, four papers on our panel demonstrate that governments and global firms have devised and used four strategies to sustain globalization in the face of rising protectionist sentiments: disguise, ride out, obfuscate and mobilize. Together, we show how survival-seeking governments and profit-seeking firms have a repertoire of tools to address changing citizen preferences abroad and that once these endogenous efforts are taken into consideration, political tensions can fuel, rather than dampen, globalization.
Li and Naoi develop and test a theory of disguise where Japanese and Chinese firms facing hostile consumers in the United States conduct mergers and acquisitions with local firms to make their companies’ national identity less visible to consumers. The paper leverages two waves of anti-Asia backlash in the United States (against Japan in the 1980s and China since 2016) with new firm-level data on mergers and acquisitions and their positions in global supply chains.
Shim and Stone study the timing and content of foreign lobbying in the United States and demonstrate that foreign firms and industries “ride out” backlash by reducing their lobbying activities when diplomatic tensions are high and frontloading their lobbying activities before issues gain salience in citizens’ minds (e.g., before the announcement of WTO disputes).
Wellhausen focuses on global waste trade where the nature of the traded good (garbage) is a public bad, and thus faces a hostile NIMBY public. The paper develops and tests a theory of obfuscation where governments change the definition of imported garbage to help garbage importers, while publicizing formal restrictions on garbage imports to appease the public. The nature of such a good flips the prediction developed in Kono (2006) –Wellhausen predicts that democracies are more likely to publicize formal restrictions on garbage imports and obfuscate non-tariff regulatory restriction. The paper leverages two novel datasets on waste trade, a new issue area of increasing importance.
Shi and Zhu turn to authoritarian China and demonstrate how the Chinese government mobilized the public support during the U.S.-China trade war through a “rally around the flag” rhetoric. With text analysis of provincial newspapers and calculation of the economic exposure to the trade war in Chinese provinces, the paper demonstrates a top-down formation of nationalist sentiments in authoritarian systems, where economic damages/hardship are correlated with the elite supply of nationalist discourse.","Megumi Naoi University of California, San Diego","Iain Osgood University of Michigan, Ann Arbor","How Political Conflicts Fuel Investment: Evidence from Japanese/Chinese Firms - Sichen Li, University of California, San Diego; Megumi Naoi, University of California, San Diego

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 2: Foundations of Political Theory,,September 15,am,10:00,11:30,Anticolonialism as a Problem in the History of Political Thought,"The question of anticolonialism is inextricably tied to the remaking of the political map of the globe and the end of formal empires in the twentieth century. Its reach, however, was neither limited to the specific project of independent postcolonial statehood nor confined within the territories of European empires. It was a language of political imagination as much as it was an answer to the question of empire. The problem of anticolonialism captured, at once, the rejection of empire, a new critique of the global racial order, the founding of democratic states in the non-European world, and the formation of a myriad of international agendas and organizations.
This panel will take up the challenge of reconsidering the place of the anticolonial moment in the history of political thought. It is premised on the contention that anticolonial political thought was more than a correction of the imperial blind spot of modern European political thought. The panel will consider how anticolonial thinkers recast foundational political ideas such as democracy and violence in the process of resisting empire. In revisiting the germane debates on the genealogy of colonialism and anticolonialism, the panel will reflect on the afterlife of anticolonial political imaginations. It also hopes to bring into view anticolonial thinkers’ reckoning with the tension between the universality of democratic political norms and the uneven global space on which such norms had to be reconstituted. In so doing, the panel seeks to explore how anticolonial thought simultaneously added to the conceptual content of modern political thought and offered resources to reflect on the global condition of modern political ideas and norms.",Karuna Mantena Columbia University,Karuna Mantena Columbia University,"Anticolonialism, Democracy and the History of Political Thought - Emma Hunter, University of Edinburgh

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 2: Foundations of Political Theory,,September 15,am,10:00,11:30,Waking Up at the End of the World: On Human Agency in the Anthropocene,"The proposed panel invites reflections on some of the most pressing challenges faced by social and ecological systems in the so-called ‘Anthropocene’. More specifically, this panel sets up a conversation that explores the divergences and convergences between bodies of literatures that seldom cross-reference each other, such as environmental ethics and green political theory, critical theory, classical political thought, and anticolonial and Indigenous resurgence scholarship. While acknowledging the importance of ecologizing Western forms of social and political theorizing, the aim of this panel is to urge the need to unsettle the premises of Euro-modern normativity that remain prevalent in mainstream political theory. Among these premises we find the disconnection of ‘society’ from ‘nature’, the theoretical separation of ‘progress’ and ‘development’ from domination and colonization, and the ahistorical view of science and technology as forming part of a universal process towards the betterment of humankind. The sort of reflections we hope to give rise to will take issue with the prevailing understandings of fundamental concepts—which have largely been assumed to pertain to human animals exclusively—such as agency, intentionality, freedom, goodness, and jurisdiction. We will also address questions related to the potential limits of traditionally Western construals of ethics and politics (e.g. Allard-Tremblay, 2019).
This panel’s diagnosis is that many apprehensions of the ‘Anthropocene’ in political theory are marked by a politics of faith (Oakeshott 1996), where human agency and innovation are seen as the path to salvation from our current road to ecological ruin. In contrast, the members of this panel adopt a politics of skepticism, which is awake to the nature of our current predicament, and where pragmatic solutions are sought. One important way through which we do this is by opening the discussion to the imaginaries and practices of peoples whose lifeways are closely in tune with the Earth (e.g., Borrows 2018; Burkhart, 2019; Kimmerer 2013; Nelson and Shilling 2018; Turner 2020). This in turn entails a theoretical shift from an anthropocentric to a more constrained and grounded biocentric understanding of reality (e.g., Cooke 2020; Frost 2020; Krause 2020; Leff 2021). Finally, we will sketch out what we see as some of the conditions of possibility for nurturing sustainable and caring relationships with the Earth and all its inhabitants—human and more-than-human, in all their diversity.
We propose the following papers: John McGuire will raise an “alternate Western tradition,” identified with Herodotus, per which Nature ‘speaks’ and re-imposes nomos by way of intrusions into human spaces and through ununsual and disturbing behaviours (e.g., horses breaking from their paddocks to devour snakes that have infested the city walls of Lydia). He will also pay attention to the way Herodotus connects dynastic fates to how kings ‘respond’ to nature (e.g., Xerxes’ doomed expedition during which he orders the river at the Hellespont to be ‘whipped’ and ‘insulted’ by his soldiers after a flood destroys a bridge). Maeve Cooke’s paper will challenge the assumptions that underlie the way we think about human agency, as well as show the interconnections between these and Western conceptions of manipulation, control, and domination. In contrast to this, her paper will propose an ethical and political rethinking of agency, one that allows us to reorient our conceptions of agency, freedom, and goodness towards ecological thriving. Yann Allard-Tremblay’s paper contributes to the Anthropocene scholarship from an Indigenous and decolonial perspective. His paper draws notably on the Land Back movement and offers a critique of the Modern and Colonial conception of sovereignty, as well as of the destructive orientation to the world that it entails and he ultimately points to the need to conceptualize jurisdiction as grounded in natural contexts. Finally, Didier Zúñiga’s paper looks at the ‘encounter’ between Spanish colonists and Mesoamerican peoples in the Valley of Mexico in the early sixteenth century and contrasts the ways they conceived of and related to ‘nature’. He takes issue with the theoretical separation of ‘progress’ and ‘development’ from domination and colonization, as well as with the ahistorical view of science and technology as forming part of a universal process towards the betterment of human life.",Hasana Sharp McGill University,Brian Burkhart University of Oklahoma,"For Those Who Will Follow; Earth Marred and Renewing Relationships - Yann Allard-Tremblay, McGill University

Indeed, some scholars suggest that from the Peace of Westphalia forward, just war language was lost in Western security discourse until the horrors of World War II forced a recovery of a moral language of war, as distinct from realpolitik and Kraigsraison.
This panel is rooted in a major database which collected arguments by U.S. presidents on the morality of peace, defense, and the use of force. The larger project seeks to show change and continuity in the language employed by presidents, from the emphasis on a responsibility for a robust national defense in 1796 to the just war language of President Obama's Nobel Peace Prize address.

Communal violence research has attracted significantly increased attention from civil war to peacekeeping and peacebuilding scholars and policy makers in recent years. The panel brings together four papers that further our understanding of the complexity of communal (‘local’) violence. The contributions draw on fieldwork-based findings from Nigeria, Mali, South Sudan and Kenya. Civil war researchers have long argued that communal or ‘local’ conflicts constitute an important dimension of the complexity of war. Peacebuilding research has called for paying more attention to the local level and the resolution of communal conflict, and peacekeeping practice increasingly focuses on communal conflict and civilian protection. However, how communal conflicts shape the landscape of political violence and how they impact peacebuilding, peace negotiations, and peacekeeping practices has remained largely unaddressed. Furthermore, the gender dimensions of communal conflict have received limited attention to date, even though women’s participation in local peacebuilding is often seen as key to peacebuilding effectiveness. This panel brings together new empirical research on the causes, dynamics, and consequences of communal violence. First, Claudia Wiehler analyzes the relationship between communal conflict and civil war in Northern Nigeria and draws conclusions for civilian protection and military intervention. Second, Adam Lichtenheld, Hilary Matfess and Jakana Thomas analyze women’s roles in the escalation and the prevention of communal violence in Mali, with important implications for peacebuilding. Third, Sophia Dawkins identifies dynamics of escalation and restraint of communal violence in the context of South Sudan’s recent civil war and peace negotiations.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 3: Normative Theory,,September 15,am,10:00,11:30,Beyond Masculinist Ideals of Resistance,"Dominant ideals of resistance are grounded in the masculinist presumption of sovereign, heroic agency, untrammelled by embodied passions, personal attachments, and situational constraints. This understanding misconstrues the experience of women resistance fighters, interpreting women’s inescapable embodiment as a constraint upon proper resistance activity. This panel aims to rethink resistance beyond the masculinist imaginary by delving into the ambiguities of women’s resistance experience. It explores how women resisters have confronted the moral dilemmas that stem from their context-specific vulnerabilities and how their actions have reframed the repressive understandings of gender difference. The purpose of this examination is to contest the oppressive implications of hegemonic visions of resistance and challenge the perpetuation of gender hierarchies after the supposedly emancipatory moment of resistance has passed. The panel fosters an interdisciplinary conversation between scholars working in the fields of social and political theory, gender studies, memory politics, sociology, history, and literature. The contributors explore the ambiguities of women’s resistance experience in a range of historical contexts and forms of resistance – from the anti-colonial revolutions of the twentieth century to the multipronged struggles for justice and equality today.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 31: Women and Politics Research,,September 15,am,10:00,11:30,Rethinking the Role of Resources in Women’s Political Participation,"This panel includes four papers about the measurement and drivers of women’s political participation in the global South. The dominant explanation for the gender gap in political participation centers on the role of economic resources. The four papers in this panel emphasize alternative ways that economics shapes women’s political behavior, from the role of economic institutions, economic bargaining power, and climate shocks. Together, the papers broaden the meaning of and explanations for how economic systems generate disparities in women’s political participation. They emphasize the role of paid and unpaid work, care and non-care work, and more broadly the effect of economic empowerment and agency on women’s political engagement. In a literature where participation is often measured as a behavioral binary, the papers contribute by demonstrating the varied nature of political engagement, and how economics can differentially shape these various forms of interaction with the state.
In their paper titled “Electoral Reforms and the Gender Gap: Evidence from Post-Suffrage Chile,” Teele, Callis, and Tuñón emphasize democratizing reforms, an institutional explanation, for women’s electoral participation in a developing country, compared to prior work on this topic focused on the world’s richest economies. These reforms led to a decrease in women’s participation areas with labor repressive agriculture, altering the value that women voters have to actors such as landlords and party operatives. The authors highlight the connection between the contours of the labor market and women’s value in the political market.
In a second paper, titled “Climate Shocks & COVID-19: Gendered effects on political preferences & behavior,” Brulé and Dixit use local geo-spatial data, existing survey data, and survey experiments to theorize the differential impact of COVID-19 and climate change on Bangladeshi women’s political participation. They argue that labor is explicitly gendered and the change in the gendered division of labor, due to the onset of COVID-19, alters women’s political preferences, and, in doing so, their autonomy and ability to create political, economic, and social change. Overall, the paper connects COVID-19 and climate change to economic agency and women’s political preferences for redistribution.
A third paper titled “The Gendered [Socio-]Economic Determinants of Political Behavior: Evidence from Nigeria”, by Nwakanma, argues that varying routes to economic empowerment for women have different effects on women’s political empowerment due to a gendered distribution of social power. The author uses participant observation, focus groups, semi-structured interviews, and survey data analysis, in addition to drawing insights from transnational, Black, and African feminist literature.
Finally, the panel includes a related paper that theorizes and measures political empowerment: “Measuring Women’s Political Empowerment: The Women as Citizens in Politics Empowerment Index” (Narain, Prillaman, and Rahman). Using survey and census datasets in the Indian context, the paper proposes and validates a measure of political empowerment. The authors argue that agency, mostly studied in the economics literature, is an important outcome in studies of women’s political inclusion. The paper expands our conception of political inequalities beyond the descriptive presence of women in political spaces to the authentic representation of women in political decision-making.
Overall, our panel presents an opportunity for papers on women in politics in a range of geographical areas and time periods, as well as using a variety of methodological approaches, to come into conversation with one another.",Diana Z.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 44: Democracy and Autocracy,,September 15,am,10:00,11:30,Information Flows and Authoritarian Control in the Digital Era,"The advancement of information technology has a significant impact on state-society relationships all over the world. On the one hand, governments, particularly authoritarian ones, have developed a wide range of advanced informational tools to control society, such as digital censorship and surveillance. Citizens, on the other hand, are subjected to a variety of information flows that are not limited to government propaganda, despite these information control strategies. Do citizens in these countries respond to information flows that are not favorable to the government? Are the digital information control strategies effective in shaping citizens’ opinions and behaviors? Are there any externalities, both positive and negative?
This panel explores these questions in the context of China, an autocracy that routinely manipulates the informational environment while communicating with citizens. Employing text analysis, Internet and in-the-field survey experiments, and observational studies, the four papers in the panel draw a mixed picture of the authoritarian state-society relationship in the digital era.
The first two papers examine whether cross-border information flows influence public opinions in China. Lu, Schaefer, Park, and Pan investigate the flows between a popular domestic and a banned international social media in China under COVID-19 using a semi-automated machine learning approach. They show that negative information from the international media can penetrate into the domestic one despite censorship. Moreover, the flows are largely driven by ordinary netizens. In contrast, Huang’s experiments conducted over two time periods—before and after the outbreak of COVID-19 and the termination of the Trump Administration—show that the U.S. Embassy’s public diplomacy had little effect on Chinese netizens’ opinions about either the countries or democracy. Xu’s and Li’s papers integrate Internet and in-the-field informational experiments. They examine the impacts of two recently developed information strategies in China: surveillance and open government information. Xu finds that, while surveillance generally deters political participation, digital surveillance is more subtle than in-person surveillance and does not undermine regime legitimacy. Li argues that open government information, as a new type of transparency, encourages citizens to prioritize legal and political institutions over protests in resolving their disputes with the government, thereby maintaining regime stability.
The proposed panel sheds light on several new forms of government information control strategies and the responses from citizens who live under digital authoritarianism. The relationship between various information flows and these citizens is crucial for the problem of authoritarian control today.",Dimitar D Gueorguiev Syracuse University,"James R.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 50: Political Networks,,September 15,am,10:00,11:30,"Networks, Governance, and Cooperation","This panel brings together a group of scholars applying novel network theories and models in the studies of armed conflict and national security from the perspective of international relations and comparative politics. Each of the papers develops new theoretical arguments and applies state-of-the-art empirical tools to explore a range of down-network political effects of relevance to the study of security and governance. The findings have important policy implications and also shed new light on the field of political networks and conflict and security issues.
The first project draws the rare connection between religious ideology and social unrest to examine their joint impact on interstate cooperative behaviors, using a novel Bayesian factor model and the context of Middle Eastern politics to empirically validate the theoretical insight. The second project uses network analysis and a newly coded cross-national dataset to explore intergroup cooperation in the context of civil war by taking into account dyadic cooperative histories, emphasizing conflict resolution as a dynamic process with roots long predating the start of formal negotiations. The third project investigates the creation of coercive institutions and within-group cooperation. The authors stress the importance of inter-group conflict that facilitates the existence of such institutions and use computational models coupled with a networked public goods game experiment to test this argument. The fourth project addresses the challenge in containing Covid-19, using a network model and daily Covid-19 data in the context of the US to understand how we can reduce contagion by disabling the transmission of most connected actors and prioritizing these people for vaccination.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 6: Political Economy,,September 15,am,10:00,11:30,Frontiers in Historical Political Economy,"Historical political economy is a growing interdisciplinary field of research that brings together social scientists who carry out historically contextualized studies to address fundamental questions in political economy. This panel aptly demonstrates the strengths of HPE research: its applicability to a broad range of political economy topics, such as of identity, gender, conflict, bureaucratic capacity, distribution, and democratic participation; the utilization of novel theoretical and empirical approaches; the availability of numerous natural experiments; and rich fine-grained data.
Boix considers the evolution of Jewish political identity in the inter-war Poland, which was shaped by the differential political treatment of Polish and Russian Jews in the Russian Empire, as shown by regression-discontinuity estimates. He argues that the triumph of an inclusive “liberal” or “bourgeois” political order was necessary for the emergence of modern national identities congruent with state borders, which challenges dominant theories of the genesis of nationalism. One of the most vivid manifestations of the oppressed position of Jews in the Russian Empire was Jewish pogroms, the causes of which are explored by Dower, Gehlbach, Kofanov and Nafziger. They use a novel settlement-level dataset on religious diversity in 1897 and the incidence of pogroms in 1904–1905. According to their findings, ethno-religious heterogeneity is an important factor not only of the emergence, but also of the propagation of conflict.
The focus of Sellars’ study is on state strategies of preventing conflict and demobilizing citizens. Using original archival data on the processing and outcome of community petitions for land redistribution in early 20th-century Mexico, she discovers that, in addition to repression and redistribution, authorities can strategically apply bureaucratic delay to defuse agrarian conflicts. The problems of civic engagement and the potential of asset ownership in promoting political participation, especially of underrepresented groups, and in strengthening democracy are analyzed in the work by Cirone, Childree, and Dienes. They take advantage of a natural experiment – the 1805 Georgia Land Lottery – which brought random windfall gains to its participants, with a focus on female lottery applicants. Cirone et al. find that lottery winners indeed exhibited greater civic participation via petitioning.
Basing on rich historical material and advanced empirical techniques, the papers of this panel revisit conventional perspectives on identities, conflict, and civil participation. They provide a more nuanced view of these phenomena, stressing the role of hitherto underexplored structural determinants, behavioral patterns, and strategic choices.",Volha Charnysh Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Volha Charnysh Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Full Paper Panel,NA,Related Groups / Conference Group on Taiwan Studies,,September 15,am,10:00,11:30,Gender and Transitional Justice and Democratization in Taiwan,"In recent years, a burgeoning literature on state repression in autocracies focuses on how dictators control the masses by employing coercive institutions and secret police. Although studies suggest that the use of repression can help dictators deal with threats from the opposition, repressive practices and state violence, on the other hand, might backfire and destabilize the regimes. However, due to the issues of authoritarian secrecy, political scientists know relatively little about the relations between autocratic leaders, coercive institutions, and repression.
In Taiwan, the Kuomintang (KMT) regime imposed martial law between 1949 and 1987, restricting civil rights and political participation to secure the authoritarian rule of Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo. The KMT established various party organs and security agencies to target political dissidents, and over ten thousand victims were arrested, tortured, imprisoned, and even killed. The period is also called the White Terror in order to describe the massive repression against civilians under an anti-communist dictatorship. Yet, the use of repression by the KMT regime and its long-term effects on political attitudes in Taiwanese society remain unclear because of the difficulties to access government archives and quantitative data previously.
This theme panel includes three papers to investigate the aspects of repression in an authoritarian context using different methodologies. Specifically, the papers will discuss the following questions: (1) What determines how dictators employ repression? (2) Is repression the most effective means to keep them in power? And, (3) how does past state repression affect contemporary political attitudes in post-authoritarian societies? Taken together, the papers aim to shed light on the understanding of authoritarian politics and state repression both theoretically and empirically.",Dennis Lu-Chung Weng Sam Houston State University,"Charles K.S.

Responding to the paragraph below, which served as a writing prompt / call for papers, these scholars have prepared submissions that fall into two sessions: 1) “Mother-Scholars Rethink Patriarchal Education” & Session 2) “Dignity, Fairness, and Care in Crisis: Towards Maternal Political Visions.” Before the workshop, all participants will have read each other’s submissions. They will arrive prepared to participate in two full-group, moderated discussions. In each session, paper writers will present their papers, followed by a full-group discussion which puts the submissions in conversation with each other. The goal is to explore overlapping themes among these scholars whose work creatively engages political facts of motherhood. The secondary goal is to provide a space for scholars of motherhood and maternal politics to develop a network.
Mothers have appeared throughout the history of political studies, often as supporting characters, apolitical or pre-political figures. Conversely, women themselves have frequently positioned motherhood as a basis for political recognition or action (e.g. Women of Liberia Mass Action For Peace, Greenham Common Women’s Peace Camp, Mothers Of The Plaza De Mayo, The Million Mom March). Others have examined motherhood as a source of alternative political values (Ruddick’s Maternal Thinking) and theories of the state (McDonagh’ The Motherless State).

Created Panel,NA,Related Groups / Critical Policy Studies,,September 15,pm,2:00,3:30,Critical Policy Analysis in and for Tumultuous Times,"The last decade has been a period of radical disruption in politics and policymaking. This sense of disruption has culminated most spectacularly in the COVID pandemic but includes also upheaval associated with rising nativism and populism across the globe, accelerating inequality in many advanced capitalist societies, the looming climate emergency facing the world, and beyond. This panel offers an opportunity to reflect on what critical policy analysis has to offer in tumultuous times. The most influential works in this tradition have typically focused on unsettling taken-for-granted norms in politics and policy, and revealing hidden struggles beneath seemingly routine practices. But what insight do these traditions and approaches have in a context of rapidly changing norms and growing public contestation and polarisation? The classics in critical policy analysis have also used interpretive and ethnographic methods that generally rely on a stable foundation of trust and rapport with policymakers, professionals and practitioners, and everyday service users and citizens. But how do these tools and techniques translate to a context of unpredictable disruption and upheaval, isolation and fragmentation?
The panel accommodates a diverse range of perspectives. We mean this not just in terms of diversity in participants, but diversity in approach to these issues and questions. Individual papers offer empirically grounded case studies that demonstrate the utility of critical policy analysis in addressing the urgent real-world problems and rapid transformations we are witnessing today. They also offer methodological commentary on how to do critical policy analysis in a post-pandemic context.",Crystal H.

Disrupted supply chains cannot immediately satisfy every material whim; stayat- home orders frustrate social spontaneity; fear of illness and death forces us to rethink our ambitions and desires. Hoping to offer reflections that might guide us through our current times, this panel investigates ancient conceptions of the relationship between politics, (in)stability, and the pursuit of our deepest longings. The five presentations consider Aristotle’s notions of happiness, Platonic eros, the impact of plague on Athenian society, and how lessons from the ancient world were transformed by later thinkers including Augustine, Lucretius, and Thomas Hobbes. By examining the many desiderata of politics, these papers explore the relationship between the desire for immortality, the quest for enduring happiness, and the basic drives of the human psyche.",Daniel Schillinger Yale University,"Zak Black University of Toronto

Coming from the fields of political history, political theory, and comparative politics, the authors shed light on the relationship and tensions between states’ control over borders and membership from three different methodological and disciplinary perspectives. The panel attempts to not only bridge approaches and disciplines but also to illuminate questions of boundary drawing on three analytical levels: Whereas Emily Yankowitz’s investigation of how African Americans claimed national citizenship through passports in pre-Dred Scott USA reveals new insights into the development of US citizenship on the national and sub-national level, Jasper T Kauth uses a comparative case study design to highlight common exclusionary patterns in the developments of migration control in the US, UK, and EU member states. Rufaida Al Hashmi and Ruairi Maguire, on the other hand, interrogate the international practice of excluding unrecognised states from global migration regimes by showing how it wrongs individual de facto citizens of those states. The panel shares a focus on migration control and citizenship in the context of state formation and political development with an emphasis on questions of justice for excluded and marginalised groups by challenging how states draw boundaries of belonging.",Jasper Theodor Kauth University of Oxford,"Desmond King University of Oxford

Perhaps nowhere is this boundary more subtle or the politics more sensitive than in issues of high technology, particularly in sectors where China is attempting to approach the technological cutting-edge. In the past few years, conflict over high-tech has become overt, in no small part because it lies at the sensitive intersection of market efficiency and national security. All of the papers in this panel address Chinese methods and strategies at technological catch-up. They consider how domestic drivers of high-tech catch-up (policies, local governments and local firms, keystone national champions) are intertwined with international interdependencies, sometimes as barriers and other times as facilitators of Chinese catchup goals. They also consider how China’s goal in catalyzing domestic innovation is integral to its regime legitimacy and vital to its evolving strategies of governance. Each paper consists of a deep dive into particular cutting-edge sectors – genetic data and biotechnology, 5G telecommunications and semiconductors, and new and old energy autos – using a variety of qualitative and quantitative data sources. Their sectoral focus allows for nuanced insights by taking the particularities of each technology seriously, while incorporating key themes in comparative and international politics, including decentralization, international interdependence, industrial policy and state-led capitalism, among others.",Jonas M.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 13: Politics of Communist and Former Communist Countries,,September 15,pm,2:00,3:30,Political Recruitment and State Capacity in China,"The Chinese bureaucracy under the CCP rule is generally regarded as strong and capable. Existing literature largely attributes this high state capacity to political selection; in particular, many studies focus on promotion and advancement within the government – its mechanisms and criteria – to examine the incentives facing government officials and their performance. In contrast, relatively little is understood about China’s political recruitment, i.e., entry-level selection, which has undergone significant reforms in the last two decades, as well as its implications on state capacity. Who wants to enter the government, and for what reason? Who gets selected? And how do they perform subsequently? These are the questions this panel seeks to shed light on.
The five papers on this panel speak coherently to the issue of political recruitment and its implications on state capacity, each examining a different avenue of entry-level recruitment. The Liu et al paper investigates the contemporary Civil Service Exam and what kind of individuals are likely to self-select into participation; the paper by Lu focuses on a special recruitment program that directly sends elite college graduates to local governments; the paper by Yi and Zhou tackles the question of membership recruitment by the CCP among college students; the Wang paper examines the performance of entry-level civil servants in Chinese localities; and finally, the Chen and Wilson paper emphasizes the Leninist structure of the CCP to explain cadre promotion.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 16: International Political Economy,,September 15,pm,2:00,3:30,Firms in the Global Economy,"Firms are the most prominent actors in the global economy. Recent literature has brought firms to the center in theory building and empirical analysis to understand the political economy of international trade and foreign direct investment (FDI). The panel collectively seeks to advance this firm-centered research agenda by examining a battery of critical questions in International Political Economy. How do firms respond to trade disputes? How do firms leverage domestic political networks for overseas expansion? How do firms actively influence trade policy? And how do firms manage the negative economic impact of a trade policy shock like the U.S.-China trade war? Jung, Owen, and Park’s paper examines the impact of WTO trade disputes on multinationals’ greenfield investment decisions. They argue that trade disputes over intermediate goods, relative to final goods, incur higher cost and risk for firms integrated into the global value chains and thus these disputes likely decrease FDI in the host while increasing FDI in other potential supplier countries; these effects are more pronounced in industries dependent more on the imports of intermediate goods. Miyano and Stanescu study the role of revolving-door hiring in encouraging Japanese firms doing business abroad. They propose two mechanisms: it brings firms access to information and resources that help firms navigate through bureaucratic regulatory procedures abroad and it builds connections with the host government that give firms a better sense of protection against future expropriation risks. Empirically, they use a novel firm-level data set consisting of 7,000 Japanese parent firms and 25,000 of their foreign subsidiaries. Cha and Osgood’s paper studies the influence of big firms in trade policy. They argue that “special interest institutions”— political rules and regulations which make it easier for corporations to participate in politics—are likely to especially empower the larger and more productive firms that support trade liberalization, thereby leading to lower trade barriers. They test the argument using data on tariffs and trade across hundreds of countries and thousands of products. Zhu, Villegas-Cruz and Waddick examine the political economy of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative’s tariff exclusion process in the U.S.-China trade war by collecting and manually coding 52,754 tariff exclusion requests submitted by firms. Preliminary results show that beneficiaries of globalization (e.g., large firms, multinationals, and those integrated into global supply chains) and politically connected firms are more likely to submit a tariff exclusion request. On the other hand, tariff exclusions—highly valuable private benefits—are used to build political support and reward donors and allies. Taken together, the four papers on the panel provide important insights into the politics of firm behavior in the global economy.",Jeffry A.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 19: International Security,,September 15,pm,2:00,3:30,Domestic Politics and Territorial Conflict,"How do domestic politics affect territorial conflict and vice versa? Many scholars agree that domestic politics play an important role in explaining the onset, duration, and outcome of territorial conflicts. Scholars also agree that how territorial conflicts are managed and resolved have far-reaching consequences for the domestic politics of contending states. There is less agreement, however, on how exactly domestic politics influence territorial conflicts and vice versa: this panel brings together papers that promise to enhance our understanding of the relationship between territorial conflicts and domestic politics, showcasing an array of new theoretical insights and empirical discoveries.
The first two papers investigate how territorial conflicts impact domestic politics. David Carter and Luwei Ying investigate how territorial conflicts affect the administrative capacity and social network of states, and how these consequences in turn influence support for populism and anti-democratic behavior. Songying Fang and Xiojun Li examine how the Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte’s conciliatory stance toward the South China Sea territorial dispute affected his domestic popularity.
The next two papers examine the other side of the coin: how domestic politics affect which territories are disputed and why. Hein Goemans examines how changes in public perception of homelands in Ecuador after 1998 affected public willingness to sacrifice for the defense of the Ecuadorian homeland. Soyoung Lee finds that states are more likely to fight over lands that do not have valuable natural resources and provides a domestic political explanation for why.",Sara McLaughlin Mitchell University of Iowa,"Dan Altman Georgia State University

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 21: Conflict Processes,,September 15,pm,2:00,3:30,"Gender, Relational Harm, and Justice: Legacies of Political Violence","Scholars of peacebuilding and transitional justice have widely acknowledged that the term ‘post-war’ is often a misnomer, particularly for those most affected by political violence (Kriesberg 2019, Friedman 2017). The continued presence and lingering effects of violence have been particularly documented in the realm of sexual and gender-based violence (Boesten 2014) and in relation to structural injustices (Lambourne 2009, Gready and Robins 2014). While literature on conflict transformation and transformative justice has made important strides in highlighting the root causes of conflict, less has been written on the long-term and gendered effects of political violence. This panel examines the “relationality” of harm and the possibilities for agency in contexts of grave human rights abuses and systematic oppression. In sustained periods of violence and atrocity, one of the greatest harms that individuals and communities experience is the violation of intimate bonds with others. Far from being a by-product of political violence, this panel takes as a starting point that the violation of intimate relationships, for instance, the forced separation of children from parents, has long been a strategy to enable mass violence and oppression. Such “relational harm” is a deeply gendered terrain, affecting women and girls in particular, and leaving gendered legacies for survivors and their communities.
This panel seeks to develop a feminist understanding of relational harm. While in recent years, scholars of transitional justice have critiqued the individualized and Western foundations of global transitional justice and its imposition on non-Western societies (Kelsall 2009, Theidon 2006, Robins 2012, Millar 2012, Shaw 2007), more needs to be done to understand harm as enabled by and targeting our relationships with others. It builds on work on complex victimhood (Baines 2015, Leebaw 2011) and feminist critiques of transitional justice as overly individualistic in orientation (Ní Aoláin 2000). The panel also draws on feminist research on care and social reproductive work (Rai, Hoskyns, and Thomas 2013).
The panel examines three inter-related sets of issues. First, how can we capture the specificity of harms that target and take advantage of individuals’ intimate relations to others? Is it useful to think about primary and secondary conceptions of harm? How is relational harm gendered? How does forced separation from others affect everyday political, social, and economic life? To what extent can we approach harm as intergenerational? Second, the panel examines how the theory and practice of transitional justice address relational harms. How have measures, such as reparations, addressed long-term legacies of violence? Who is seen and whose stories gain visibility during and after violence (Berry 2018, Friedman 2018, Ketola 2020)? Third, the panel considers the resilience and agency of victim-survivors. We are conscious of the risk of pre-determining experiences of harm and seek to critically engage with important concepts integral to relational harm, particularly the nuclear family, motherhood and fatherhood (Peterson 2020). How have victim survivors demanded space and recognition? How have people and communities mobilized on behalf of lost or missing loved ones? What are the ethical and political implications of examining experiences of harm and expressions of agency together?
The panel brings together scholars addressing multiple dimensions of political violence across different geographical contexts and temporalities. This includes disappearances in Sri Lanka, African American experiences of slavery, forced motherhood in the Lord’s Resistance Army in northern Uganda, and the conflict in Northern Ireland. To explore synergies, the panel brings together a range of approaches from political science, feminist studies, legal studies, critical ethnography, and peace and conflict studies. As such, it advances plural understandings of agency, harm, and justice to establish new grounds for critical interventions in the fields of transitional justice and peacebuilding.",Helen Kinsella,Helen Kinsella,"Violations of the Heart: Parental Harm in Contexts of Systematic Violence - Rebekka C.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 25: Public Policy,,September 15,pm,2:00,3:30,Theoretical Refinements to the Multiple Streams Framework,"Despite being one of the most prolific theories of policy change, applications of the Multiple Streams Framework (MSF) have been criticized for failing to rigorously and consistently apply and test key theoretical constructs. A growing network of scholars has sought to address these shortcomings by developing a systematic agenda for MSF scholarship grounded in shared hypotheses, a commitment to applying both qualitative and quantitively analyses, and a desire to understanding the theory’s explanatory power in international and transnational contexts. This panel showcases cutting edge work in each of these areas by bringing together papers by leading MSF researchers.
In the first paper, Nikolaos Zahariadis uses the MSF to explore policymaking in Greece during the COVID-19 pandemic. Significantly, he shows that prolonged policy windows increase the risk that policy entrepreneurs come to be seen as political actors, as opposed to technical experts, in turn heightening the possibility of widespread political conflict and controversy. In the second paper, Rob DeLeo develops a novel methodology for applying MSF to state legislatures, which have yet to be systematically studied within the MSF literature. Using data derived from state house news service websites and floor debates, he specifically analyzes the effect of potential focusing events, in this instance coastal flooding, on the environmental policy agenda of Massachusetts State Legislature. In the third paper, Annemieke van den Dool considers MSF’s applicability to non-democracies and the Chinese state more specifically. She uses a case study of China’s ongoing debate surrounding soil pollution to test various MSF hypotheses, including those relating to policy windows and interest group mobilization. Finally, Kristin Taylor leverages key insights from the MSF literatures on problem indicators and focusing events to develop a dynamical theory for conceptualizing the problem stream. She suggests refining the problem stream in order to account for problem signaling, a term used to characterize the middle ground between problems revealed through numeric measures and those revealed through disasters.
Collectively, these papers shed new light on the explanatory power of MSF while testing important hypotheses. It demonstrates MSF’s development over the last decade while highlighting remaining gaps in existing knowledge. The panel will thus provide a welcome opportunity for policy scholars and other meeting attendees to learn more about the varieties of MSF research while spotlighting potentially fruitful areas of future research.",Thomas A.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 34: Representation and Electoral Systems,,September 15,pm,2:00,3:30,The Impact of Electoral System Reform in New Democracies,"Electoral studies stand up as the most advanced research area in the analysis of institutions as explanatory variables. Political scientists are not only able to explain but also predict in relatively simple equations the average mechanical and strategic effects of electoral rules on party systems. Significant progress has also been achieved in the study of the impact of electoral rules on the representation of ideological positions, women, territorial interests, and ethnic groups. Yet we still have a poor understanding of the party system and representation effects of electoral rules in new democracies. As a response to radical changes in partisan configurations and representation crises, new democracies frequently alter or replace electoral formulas, district magnitudes, voter and party registration rules, and representation mechanisms to stabilize party systems or make the political system more inclusive. However, whereas these goals are often realized in the short term, the effects of these reforms tend to deviate from the expectations of both designers and students of electoral systems over time.
This panel seeks to discuss the effects of electoral reforms on party systems and gender representation in Latin American democracies. All the papers deal with recent institutional transformations in the electoral system. Two papers (by Bunker and Negretto and Navia) examine how major alterations of key components of electoral systems have led to unexpected outcomes in the number of parties competing and winning votes in legislative elections and in the behavior of voters. The other two (by Gilas and Suarez-Cao) explore the struggle to adopt innovations that improve the descriptive representation of women and the challenges faced to turn this representation into actual spheres of influence and power within legislative bodies. In all, this panel shows the progress made and the challenges ahead in the study of party system effects and gender representation in new democracies using several recent institutional reforms and political events in Latin America as evidence. It provides a fresh examination of how electoral incentives, in interaction with extra-institutional factors, affect party landscapes, representation, and the distribution of power in democratic regimes with highly unstable political environments.",Sona N.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 44: Democracy and Autocracy,,September 15,pm,2:00,3:30,Democratic Ceilings: The Curious Stability of Low-Quality Democracies,"The the field of democracy studies has been jolted by democratic backsliding in prominent cases such as the United States and the United Kingdom, reigniting debates over how democracies die. Yet instances of democratic erosion and breakdown do not provide the full picture of the challenges faced by today’s democracies. In particular, a considerable subset of Third Wave democracies faces a different kind of challenge: they are weak but stable democracies that hit a democratic ceiling, and fail to improve the illiberal quality of their democratic institutions and norms despite increasing maturity and stability. In brief, they are examples of a low-quality democratic equilibrium.
We propose a panel that addresses this largely ignored challenge to democracies around the world. The panel addresses questions such as: Does a systematic analysis of cross-national data better support a democratic recession or democratic stagnation? What explains democratic, yet suboptimal equilibria? How do long-standing, structural factors such as state capacity, limits of public opinion, nation-building, and social cleavages stall and cap democratic progress? What is the relationship between democratic ceilings and democratic breakdown?
The panel brings together a global group of scholars ranging from junior to senior ranks. It begins with a bird’s eye overview of historical data on democracies and their trajectories (Treisman). Then each of the papers examines a distinct explanation for democratic ceilings across the regions that were at the heart of the Third Wave of democratization: Latin America (Munck), East Asia (Hur and Yeo), Eastern Europe (Klasnja and Pop-Eleches), and Southeast Asia (Roy and Tudor).",Grigore Pop-Eleches Princeton University,"Robert R.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 56: American Political Thought,,September 15,pm,2:00,3:30,American Constitutional Politics in the 19th Century,"This panel features four papers that examine American constitutional politics in the nineteenth century. Spanning from the early national period through the Civil War and into the Gilded Age, the papers take up constitutive questions of eras that both overlap and are arrayed chronologically. George Thomas and Mariah Zeisberg take a broad view of this period. Thomas’s paper addresses the place of Black citizenship prior to the Civil War; in so doing, he identifies the role this constitutional disharmony played in forging American constitutional identity. Zeisberg’s paper explores family-making as a mode of constitutional argumentation in debates over slavery and the socio-political structures it supported. Leveraging Gretchen Ritter’s conception of the Constitution as social design (2006), Zeisberg engages the integrated verbal and lived critique advanced by those who targeted the distinctions among civic, political, and social rights that governed the legal world of their time.
The focal points of Jordan Cash’s and Robinson Woodward-Burns’s papers are, respectively, inscribed within and adjoined to the period Thomas and Zeisberg evaluate. Bringing a comparative perspective to the panel, Cash’s paper examines the 1836 constitution of the Republic of Texas as an episode of both constitutional creation and criticism. In addition to highlighting ways in which the Texas constitution diverged from the US Constitution, Cash brings to light an intersection between Latin American and Anglo-American constitutional thought. Finally, Woodward-Burns’s contribution advances an explanatory framework for “constitutional hardball,” in which legislators bend lawmaking rules to entrench party interests. Using the Enabling and Admission Acts of 1889-90 as a case study, he demonstrates how cyclical periods of congressional polarization and party parity incentivize political behavior that can give rise to new constitutional structures. Interrogating fundamental constitutional continuities while also illuminating episodes of disjunction and innovation, these papers offer a kaleidoscopic view of American constitutional politics in a (trans)formative period.",Connor Ewing University of Toronto,"Jeremy D.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 6: Political Economy,,September 15,pm,2:00,3:30,The Political Economy of Land and Natural Resource Conflict,"This panel weaves together comparative research on land and natural resource conflict. The motivation for this panel lies in studying the political consequences of increasing land scarcity. Infrastructure projects, urban areas, and the extraction of natural resources has expanded dramatically around the world in the past two decades, but such projects also frequently encounter resistance from a variety of actors (Temper, Del Bene and Martinez- Alier, 2015; Borras Jr and Franco, 2013; Boone, 2014). The Environmental Justice Atlas records more than 3,500 ongoing environmental conflicts around land and natural resources. Such disputes are costly to society at large: infrastructure projects that are vital for improving economic development can be blocked or attacked. Understanding the causes and consequences of conflict is important for policy as well as for theoretical reasons. Given the state's involvement in land and other natural resource administration, studying land and natural resource conflict can help us better understand the role of the state in economic development.
When does conflict over land and natural resources develop? Who are the actors? How can the state respond to resistance? Papers in this panel explore these inter-related questions, using a political economy perspective and generating comparative insights on the politics of land and natural resource conflict. The first two papers in the panel focus on who different agents in natural resource conflict are and where conflict is likely to break out. A paper by Rigterink et al., “Mining Competition and Violent Conflict in Africa”, argues that conflict between artisanal and industrial miners is an important source of mining conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zimbabwe, despite prior research focusing primarily on conflict between state and non-state actors. Christensen et al. in their paper, “The Point of Attack: Where and Why Does Oil Cause Armed Conflict in Africa?” provide a new theory for why rebels rarely attack oil-rich sites, even though these offer the most lucrative prizes.
The last two papers in the panel examine the state’s response to land-related conflict and the consequences of state action. Tóth in her paper, “Roads of Resistance: Theory and Evidence on Eminent Domain Conflict from India”, offers a theory for how the state manages eminent domain conflict. She argues that bureaucrats’ informal ties to politicians and other bureaucrats are critical in undercutting landowners' resistance, because these relationships enable coordination within the state to coerce landowners into giving up landholdings. Lastly, a paper by Albertus titled “The Political Price of Authoritarian Control: Evidence from Francoist Land Settlements in Spain” addresses what happens once the state mitigates land conflict by land resettlement schemes. This paper finds that political control and economic manipulation exerted by the state in settler colonies motivates a backlash against ruling parties later on.",Steven I.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Related Groups / Eric Voegelin Society,,September 15,pm,2:00,3:30,"Liberalism, Nation, and Modern Techne in George Grant","Eric Voegelin's critiques of technological modernity were shared by George Parkin Grant, perhaps Canada's most distinctive political philosopher. The sojourn of APSA to Grant's Canadian homeland offers an opportunity to explore Grant's thought in light of contemporary political developments. These include the rise of nationalism, the pushback against neoliberalism, the spread of identity politics, the rise of social media, and of course the continuing response to the COVID pandemic.
Grant wrote extensively on ancient and modern techne, and foresaw many political effects of digital technology. He also wrote widely on liberalism and its potentially universalizing tendencies, particularly in the context of the United States. Grant explored these themes by reference to great canonical thinkers such as Plato, Augustine, Hegel, Nietzsche, and Heidegger. Yet he also connected them to political phenomena, most notably the possibility of a distinct Canadian nation sharing a continent with the American colossus. The arrival of APSA in Canada would no doubt have provoked his pen.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Theme Panel,,September 15,pm,2:00,3:30,"Rethinking Freedom in a Digital, Viral World: Free Speech as a Case Study","Constitutionally exogenous factors such as population growth, urbanization, wealth (and inequality), and scientific/technological advances require the rearticulation of the scope and definition of individual rights and government powers. This is not unprecedented. Advances in technology such as the telephone and surveillance devices resulted in a judicial reconsideration of privacy notions such as “search and seizure.” Economic changes and the great depression resulted in fundamental changes in the U.S. Supreme Court’s approach to property rights. Currently, the pandemic is forcing nations to reconsider religious freedom and conscientious objection. Finally, the internet has so amplified the viral power of speech that nations are now struggling to draft revenge porn laws that are not overbroad.
The panel resonates ideally with the conference theme “Rethink, Restructure, and Reconnect: Towards A Post-Pandemic Political Science.” The post-pandemic world will be (already is) characterized by disruptions caused by these factors. The panel is comprised of a multinational, interdisciplinary group of faculty representing law, political science, English, and linguistics who hail from five countries and four continents.

The Covid-19 pandemic has made the issue more urgent than usual, but the question is an old one. From Plato's philosopher-kings to Hannah Arendt's problem-solvers, the need for expert involvement in politics in general, and democracies in particular, has attracted much scholarly debate. In this debate some examine how the democratic process might be affected by the introduction of unelected actors; others have formulated various proposals for checks on the quality and range of knowledge made available; others have questioned whether expertise is ever immune from politicisation. While perhaps the most sustained conversation on this topic has taken place in political theory, of both analytical and historical persuasions, there is significant purchase for gaining clarity on the scope and limitations of expertise to the field of international relations (IR) too. Not least given the transnational nature of most challenges addressed by delegation to or with advice from technical and scientific experts, it seems crucial to bridge the disciplinary divide and share insights from both perspectives.
This panel therefore encourages a conversation across the 'big tent' on the relationship between expertise and politics in both domestic and global governance contexts. The panel's contributions aim to both theorise and concretise the meaning of expert authority and legitimacy, as well as the ways in which politics navigates expertise and, inversely, experts navigate politics. The goal is to examine, from different perspectives (some to vindicate expertise, others to challenge its use), the pragmatic limits of expertise in politics, and to understand what those mean for the general relationship between the two. Is the use of experts by definition undemocratic, or ""extra-democratic""? Is expertise primarily about status or about knowledge? Do different criteria apply to different types of experts, and if so, is the generic category of 'expertise' helpful at all? These are the important questions addressed, in different and diverging ways, by the papers in this panel. In conjunction, they stimulate a conversation across disciplinary divides that brings up new answers and new questions.",Samuel Ely Bagg University of South Carolina,Jeffrey Friedman Harvard University,"Is Expert Authority Epistemic? - Jan Eijking, University of Oxford

How does the state establish its justice system in the peripheries? How do insurgent groups use law and courts to build legitimacy? How does corruption affect property rights? This panel will discuss the central questions of political development – state-building, center-periphery relations, legitimacy, corruption – through the lenses of law and courts. A particular methodological focus of the panel is on the analysis of large datasets of judicial records – both archival and contemporary. Edgar Franco-Vivanco will present co-authored work with Fiona Shen-Bayh on the imperial strategies of control of colonial elites through law using unique archival data on the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, the court of final appeal for British Overseas Territories. The presentation will focus on the interpretation and resolution of conflicts from African appellants. Jordan Gans-Morse will present co-authored work with David Szakonyi, on the effects of corruption on the resolution of business disputes in commercial courts of Moscow. Using income and asset disclosures to create unique individual-level measures of corruption for court judges and relying on random distribution of cases across judges in nearly 2 million decisions from 2011-2018, the authors show that corrupt judges are more likely to find in favor of wealthier litigants, back private firms in their disputes with government agencies, and rush in passing down decisions. Egor Lazarev will present co-authored work on the legal ramifications of the drastic political change – forced incorporation of Crimea and Sebastopol in the Russian Federation in 2014. Using the data from the same commercial courts that are studied in Gans-Morse and Szakonyi’s work, the study explores the transformation of state-society and state-business relations under profound political change. The analysis compares judicial decisions in Crimea under Ukrainian and de facto Russian jurisdiction and also compares judges from were reappointed in 2014 with the new ones. Mara Revkin will present her book project on ISIS’ legality and its role in the perceptions of the group state-building project in Iraq and Syria. She will document how ISIS offered an alternative system of law and order, including its own courts, police, and legislation-like rules— that initially appealed to a critical mass of Syrians and Iraqis. The research is based on qualitative and quantitative data collected over the course of more than two years of field research including an original household survey; in-depth interviews, and a dataset of more than 1,500 Arabic primary source documents.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 13: Politics of Communist and Former Communist Countries,,September 15,pm,4:00,5:30,"Technologies of Governance in China: Law, Campaigns, and Social Credit","From COVID-related controls, to expanding facial recognition surveillance, to a crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong, the Chinese Communist Party’s control of over a billion people seems only to increase. The system it has created looks highly effective and may be unique. Many of its technologies of governance appear highly innovative. The papers in this panel help explain these technologies, but also problematize them. Specifically, we look at the convergence, overlap, competition, and collision between three different technologies of governance with vastly different histories: 1) law and courts, which have been used to govern for thousands of years; 2) campaigns, which were most notably used in the Mao-era; 3) and China’s emerging social credit system, a recent innovation that is sometimes depicted more as science fiction than current reality.
While the panel offers different theoretical and methodological perspectives, the themes and findings of the papers knit together tightly. Li and Kostka’s paper shows that while theoretical support for China’s social credit system is remarkably high, it is largely ignored by the vast majority of Chinese. Haemin Jee compliments this by showing what the social credit is really used for: targeting commercial actors, consolidating information, and adding punishments and support to the existing infrastructure of laws and courts. The necessity of such institutional proliferation is seen in Cheng and Ma’s paper which demonstrates that even after reforms that seem to be aimed at compelling courts to take more cases against local governments, the effect is quickly dissipated. This phenomenon of legal reforms having only small or temporary effects is further investigated by Givens, Goron, and Scoggins as they use legal advice websites to show that scandals disseminated through viral social media and campaigns have more impact than changes to the formal legal system on the behavior of both average people and lawyers.
A few important themes run throughout these papers. Apparent innovations ranging from the creation of local social credit systems, to new domestic violence and environmental laws, to reforms of administrative litigation and policing may appear to be game-changing and yet prove to have little impact or to suffer from a rapid reversion to the status quo. In part, this seems to be because many of these innovations are not taken up by average Chinese or even the lawyers that represent them, a trend that can be occasionally reversed by social-media-fueled scandals and government-led campaigns. For all its innovation and institutional proliferation, the system the Chinese state has created still leaves considerable doubt as to the ultimate success and sustainability of its efforts to create a more sophisticated and effective system of technologies of governance.",William Hurst University of Cambridge,"Andrew MacDonald Duke Kunshan University

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 23: Presidents and Executive Politics,,September 15,pm,4:00,5:30,The Growing Influence of the Vice Presidency and Its Impacts,"The evolution and expansion of vice-presidential influence is due to three factors that developed especially after World War II. First, the increase in executive powers due to growing demands and expectations on the White House prompted presidents to assign more responsibilities to their vice presidents (Goldstein 1982). Second, the institutionalization of the vice presidency has allowed the officeholders to exert a more significant influence on the president because of the resources now allocated to them, which gives them access to the same information as the president (Light 1984). Finally, the preponderance of outsider presidents – who know little about Washington and its ways –makes presidential candidates choose their running mate more based on experience and competence than on electoral assets (Kamarck 2016). Thus, as presidential powers expand, so do those of the vice presidents. Several studies have demonstrated the expansion of the role of vice presidents since Walter Mondale, particularly in foreign policy (Kengor 2000, Lechelt 2009). The vice presidencies of Al Gore and Dick Cheney are also two transformational moments, because their vast experience allowed them to play a leading role in their respective administration and to be seen as presidents’ equals – even as more presidential than the president, especially during their first terms – and to have a clear and direct influence on many of their administration’s policies. These cases are unique in many ways. Yet all three demonstrate how the influence of the vice president has changed over time, whether on the president himself, on the decision-making process, or on the issues. However, few studies attempt to understand the nature of the fluctuations in this influence – either between vice presidents or between the two terms of the same vice president – or how vice presidents affect the political system itself. The presentations of this panel aim to contribute to fill these gaps to better define and anticipate the role of vice presidents in the future.",Christopher John Devine University of Dayton,"Roy E.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 34: Representation and Electoral Systems,Division 11: Comparative Politics,September 15,pm,4:00,5:30,Centripetal Democracy in America: Ranked Choice Voting in Theory and Practice,"Ranked Choice Voting is being adopted by an increasing number of jurisdictions across the United States and, by the end of this year, will be used by both Alaska and Maine for both state and federal general elections, including to the presidency. Advocates for RCV, such as Francis Fukuyama and Larry Diamond, identify it as a crucial institutional response to runaway polarization, to deep and dangerous forms of political division, and to democratic backsliding.
This panel brings together empiricists and normative theorists to share research on recent innovations in RCV in the United States and to discuss the wider implications of these findings. One team of researchers will report ongoing research on the recent Mayoral elections in New York. Another will consider whether the new Alaskan “final five” system might help mitigate dangerous forms of political polarization. Finally, two political theorists will provide complementary analyses that attempt to dig deeper into our grounds for valuing the use of preferential voting systems in rich post-industrial countries such as the United States (and, perhaps, for being wary of their use).
Ranked-choice voting is “centripetal” in the sense that it is expected to provide incentives for centre-seeking behaviour by office-seekers. Many participants in this panel also analyse RCV through a more elaborate theory of centripetal institutions that was originally developed by researchers studying democracy in deeply divided societies (Horowitz 1992; Reilly 2001). This approach is grounded on the underlying (and perhaps controversial) intuition that polarization in the contemporary US is sufficiently deeply connected to people’s social identities to be analysed with tools developed to understand polities with profound ethnic, religious, or linguistic division.
The panel attempts to build new lines of discourse across the subdisciplines of political science. In the present juncture, scholars of American electoral politics might fruitfully engage with students of democracy in deeply divided societies. Normative democratic theorists, who have previously tended to pay surprisingly little attention to debates about alternative electoral systems, can learn from both of them – and can perhaps, building on the work of “centripetalists” and other empiricists, help develop new frameworks for relating diverse democratic procedures to fundamental political values.",,"Donald L.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 35: Political Organizations and Parties,Related Groups / Labor Politics,September 15,pm,4:00,5:30,The Enduring Political Influence of Teachers Unions in the United States,"The strength of organized labor in the United States has been waning for decades. Yet, public sector labor has offered a beacon of hope, with membership levels remaining relatively stable around 35% (BLS 2021). However, a variety of developments over the last decade and a half have presented major existential threats. How has public sector labor weathered the various challenges that have come to pass? From adverse labor law to slashed budgets in the wake of the Great Recession to the murder of George Floyd and the call to face systemic racism, to say nothing of the major challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, it has not been an easy time to represent government workers.
This is perhaps most true for teacher unions, the largest and most powerful public sector unions (Moe 2011). This panel uses the case of teacher unions to explore how public sector unions have grappled with the challenges of the last decade. It asks, what strategies have teacher unions engaged in to retain membership, shape the public debate, and hold onto political power? Moreover, what have been the consequences of these actions for teachers, union power, electoral outcomes, and what occurs in schools?
The four papers on this panel suggest that teacher unions have been innovative in coping with the challenges of the day – shifting their militancy, rhetoric, and professional programming – and have managed to achieve their desired outcomes – getting their candidates elected and inserting education issues into the public conversation. Taken together, the papers suggest that public sector unions are resilient and may have preserved their power, despite the setbacks of recent years.
The four papers utilize a range of data and methods. The Lyon and Kraft paper draws on strike data and political ads to examine whether teacher strikes led more education issues to appear in Congressional election ads. The Hartney and Kogan study uses survey experiments to show that teacher union endorsements increase voters' support for school board candidates. The Finger paper utilizes Twitter data to explore how the banning of agency fees impacts union rhetoric. And the Dahill-Brown and Lavery paper uses semi-structured interviews of union leaders to study how the murder of George Floyd impacted union actions around race.
If the papers on this panel are any indication, teacher unions will weather the current COVID-19 blowback they are facing and will continue to be influential political actors going forward. More broadly, public sector unions are likely to remain influential interest groups in American politics.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 44: Democracy and Autocracy,,September 15,pm,4:00,5:30,Emotions and Political Behavior under Authoritarianism,"Emotions, especially with respect to the effects of discrete emotions, have been extensively studied in the public opinion literature during the last two decades. It has been documented that certain emotions, such as fear, anger, and enthusiasm, affect information search, opinion formation, and taking risky or costly political decisions. However, these studies have been mostly limited to democratic polities, and interest in political emotions under authoritarian conditions have stayed limited. Authoritarian regimes have predominantly been described as de-mobilizing regimes, and authoritarian propaganda has been understood as primarily a tool of projecting power, rather than evoking genuine emotions.
We believe that more focus on affective politics is necessary to better understand patterns of public opinion and behaviour under contemporary authoritarian regimes. First, most forms of mass political behaviour in authoritarian regimes fall under the category of risky or costly behaviour. By definition, authoritarian regimes do not provide institutional guarantees to freely express political views, organize, or protest. The mobilizing or demobilizing power of emotions become especially relevant here. Second, authoritarian countries are characterized by unequal access to media environment as most of the media organizations are under the government control. This gives authoritarian governments a unique advantage to manipulate the affective landscape in the country through concerted and intensive use of authoritarian propaganda. It is still an open question, however, whether authoritarian governments really try to evoke emotional reactions and whether they can be successful in this when they try it.
This panel brings together four papers that explore the role of emotions under authoritarian regimes. The selection presents a wide range of diversity in terms of cases and methodologies, while talking to each other in terms of their research questions. Russia, China, Turkey, and Palestinian Authority are cases covered in this panel. Emotions, the key variable of interest, is measured through self-reported survey questions, the analysis of vocal pitch in propaganda videos, and forms of text analysis. The research questions, on the other hand, revolve around the issue of authoritarian regime support.
Robertson et al. and Dornschneider both explore how political emotions mediate the relationship between regime repression and mass behavior. Through a survey experiment conducted in Russia, Robertson et al. unpack the different individual reactions to repression and investigate their implications for subsequent attitudes and behavior. In addition to demonstrating that repression can lead to both fear and anger with diverging implications, they also explore how repression is linked to perceptions of legitimacy for the regime. Dornschneider, on the other hand, investigates emotions of anger and fear, as well as overall negativity and positivity, through interview transcripts of residents living in Palestine. The findings show that the transcripts display both emotions of fear and anger, with fear levels exceeding anger levels. The paper moreover conducts a comparative analysis, comparing the interview transcripts to Facebook entries from during the Arab Spring and speech data from Palestinian leaders.
Ozturk and Chen et al. primarily focus on regime propaganda and authoritarian regimes' efforts to evoke emotional reactions from citizens. Ozturk traces widespread economic misperceptions among regime supporters in Turkey back to narratives and symbols used by the regime. By combining observational and experimental data at the individual level, he argues that the regime’s economic narratives have an emotional structure, and this emotional structure is instrumental to both improve economic expectations and create charismatic attachments to the authoritarian leader. Chen et al., on the other hand, focus on documenting the emotional propaganda used by the Chinese regime. In addition to exploring when and how the regime adopts emotional propaganda, they also develop audio-as-data approach, which will be useful to study the emotional content of regime propaganda through audio recordings.",Shana Kushner Gadarian Syracuse University,"Discussants of this panel are Lauren Young (UC Davis) and Katerina Tertytchnaya (University College London).

Increasingly, scholars are also asked to justify ethical choices to their peers in “ethics appendices” (Baron & Young, 2021; Asiedu, Karlan, Lambon-Quayefio, & Udry, 2021) or to prespecify how they will make decisions related to ethics similar to preregistration of study designs (Lyall, 2019). Yet there is a challenge with this status quo: determining risks and benefits is not straightforward. Political scientists are caught, with the desire and necessity of meeting raised ethical standards, but without the tools to do so.
In this panel, we explore new ideas for assessing risk-benefit tradeoffs that go beyond IRB review. We emphasize tools for experimental research in political science, where researchers face especially strong desires and pressures to improve both the ethical status and their justification. In “The Ethics of Electoral Experimentation: Design-Based Recommendations,” Tara Slough introduces a framework for assessing the risk of changing aggregate electoral outcomes in experiments and assessing tradeoffs between these risks and scientific goals such as statistical power. In “The ethics of payment in online panels,” Heike Klüver, Johannes Giesecke, Felix Hartmann, Ferdinand Geißler, and Macartan Humphreys present data on the wages and alternative time uses of online research participants. The authors’ results provide a way for researchers to assess tradeoffs between the ethical goal of providing a living wage and the researcher need to recruit sufficiently sized online participant pools. In “How participation in human subjects research affects human subjects,” Graeme Blair, Rebecca Littman, Rebecca Wolfe, Ben Crisman, and Sarah Ryan propose research designs to assess the causal effects of research studies and their components on participants. The authors illustrate the approach with application to the effects of asking survey respondents about personal experiences of violence on mental health symptoms. In the final paper, “Ethics and society review: Ethics reflection as a precondition to research funding,” Michael S. Bernstein, Margaret Levi, David Magnus, Betsy A. Rajala, Debra Satz, and Charla Waeiss propose a new form of review for research studies to assess their ethical status and impacts on society, meeting the need of researchers to receive feedback on their research designs and an independent assessment of the ethical status of the design beyond the limited focus of the IRB. By providing new tools for assessing the risks and costs in a particular setting, these four papers provide a way for researchers to develop and then justify ethical research designs.",Dawn L.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 52: Migration & Citizenship,,September 15,pm,4:00,5:30,Forced Displacement and Return under Oppressive Regimes,"Since 2020, COVID-19 pandemic-induced border closures and the spread of the disease in crowded refugee camps have increased calls for refugee return as well as made information about refugees and the internally displaced harder to obtain. Seeking to shed light on these issues, this panel brings together four papers which explore the movement and return of peoples fleeing conflict and oppressive regimes. Drawing on experiences of refugees and internally displaced in Syria and Iraq, as well as in one case historical data from Sweden, these papers outline the role of government and community connections in decision making for the displaced. Emphasizing the importance of novel data for studying hard to reach populations, especially during the pandemic, each paper leverages a different data source ranging from google search queries to social media data, surveys, and historical data. Two of the papers consider the importance of predicting migrant decisions, whether in regards to return or settlement within a host country, in order to allocate goods and services. In doing so they rely on exploring community connections, in one case through discussion of local conditions on social media and in the other through google search queries for certain provinces. The third paper considers community reaction to returnees using survey data to probe social acceptance of returning IDPs. The fourth paper broadens the scope, using a combination of country comparisons and analysis of post-World War II refugee return to assess whether regime transition impacts return for those fleeing oppressive governments. When considered together, these papers provide insight into the role community and governance play in the decision making process and experience of displaced peoples and shed light on when return may occur and how to support these groups.",Erin Elizabeth Walk Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Daniel Masterson University of California, Santa Barbara","Syrian Refugee Migration and Return on Social Media - Erin Elizabeth Walk, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Kiran Kiran Garimella; Fotini Christia, Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 6: Political Economy,,September 15,pm,4:00,5:30,New Applications of Computational Text Analysis in Historical Political Economy,"Innovations in computational text analysis and ongoing efforts to collect and digitize historical documents are opening new inroads for research on social and political phenomena. In particular, many of these tools are well-suited to offer important contributions to the growing field of Historical Political Economy (HPE), as they provide new ways to systematically measure complex political processes over long periods of time, ranging from actors’ revealed preferences on specific policy domains to broader patterns of ideational change.
This panel will explore recent applications of computational text analysis within the field of HPE. The papers included in the panel bring together an international group of junior and senior scholars that draw on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze processes of state-building, investments in public goods provision, the rise of parliamentary supremacy, and the development of proto-democratic ideas in seventeenth-century England.
In the first paper, “How the Levellers Thought: Populism, Radicalism and Pamphlet Campaigns between the English Civil Wars”, Melissa Ann Schwartzberg (NYU) and Arthur Spirling (NYU) use computational text analysis to analyze the evolution of Leveller views about rights and universal suffrage between the First and Second English Civil Wars. To this end, they draw on word embeddings trained on Early Modern English parliamentary speeches to analyze a new collection of over 200 Leveller pamphlets. By exploring how the “meaning” of concepts at the center of modern liberal democracy developed over time, the paper contributes not only to current debates on the origins of European democratization, but also opens new ground in the use of NLP techniques in intellectual history and political theory.
The second paper, “Parliament Strikes Back: Agenda-Setting and Power Voids in Early Representative Assemblies”, also looks at seventeenth-century England but to explain the rise of parliamentary supremacy. Toni Rodon (Pompeu Fabra) and Tom Paskhalis (LSE) apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation models on English parliamentary journals from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to develop a measure of the agenda-setting power of parliamentary elites. They then use this measure of institutional power to show that elites exploited political crises to expand the competence of Parliament over a wider array of issues and thus increase their influence over political affairs.
In the third paper, “The Politics of Ratchet Effects: Fiscal Development after the British Interventions in Crimea and South Africa”, Oriol Sabaté (University of Barcelona) and Agustín Goenaga (Lund University) revisit debates about whether the rise of taxation at the turn of the twentieth century was primarily driven by popular mobilization or by external military pressures. They combine new fiscal data with the computational analysis of parliamentary debates to explain why war increases in income taxation were rolled back after the Crimean War (1853-1856) but persisted after the Second Boer War (1899-1902). They argue that MP’s positions on the permanence of wartime taxation were shaped by whether voters in their constituencies were more or less likely to be exempt from those taxes. Suffrage reforms that lowered voting requirements between the two conflicts led to a larger share of voters being exempt from wartime taxation during the Second Boer War, creating incentives for more MPs to advocate for the persistence of those taxes.
Finally, the paper by Ashrakat Elshehawy (Oxford University), “The Economic History of the Legislative Debate of Public Good Provision under Colonialism: A Computational Text-Analysis Approach”, moves beyond the British case to study investments in public goods provision in Egypt between 1882 and 1952. Drawing on historical census data, geospatial data extracted from historical maps, and the computational analyses of Egyptian parliamentary minutes, Elshehawy examines which factors shaped the extent to which MPs discussed public service provision. She shows that MPs from religious minorities, MPs that were part of the Muslim religious and business elites, and MPs from more diverse districts were more likely to push for investments in public services.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 6: Political Economy,,September 15,pm,4:00,5:30,The Political Economy of Infrastructure,"Why do politicians pursue infrastructure projects? And when do voters reward them at the polls? Conventional wisdom is that politicians invest in infrastructure to claim credit, cut the ribbon, and win votes from visible investment projects. This panel instead explores a series of alternative motivations and constraints on infrastructure provision in developing countries. Holland shows how politicians in Latin America aim to assign infrastructure contracts and gain campaign contributions with limited concern for whether projects are finished. Barros demonstrates how Brazilian politicians may avoid infrastructure provision to minimize blame when they lack the administrative resources to complete projects. Garfías explores how infrastructure provision affects tax compliance in Mexico. Finally, Agnihotri et al. look at lucrative land rents around infrastructure projects in India. They show how politicians extract land rents by rewarding or punishing the bureaucrats who administer land with personnel transfers. Combined, the papers uncover a richer set of incentives—contracts, blame avoidance, tax compliance, and land rents—that shape when politicians provide infrastructure and how limited state capacity in developing countries influences the extent and type of infrastructure provision. To do so, they deploy a range of methods, including quantitative analysis of administrative data, field experiments, surveys, and qualitative interviews.",Anjali Thomas Georgia Institute of Technology,"Aliz Toth Stanford University

Amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic, the institutional crisis has raised questions about the role of political leaders, their parties, the bureaucracy, and society's themselves to deal with a sort of democratic backsliding.

Drawing from a rich scholarship, recent research has started to push new frontiers. This panel takes stock of these developments and aims to mainstream their insights by discussing their theoretical and methodological implications for feedback studies. Four new directions are paid particular attention. First, echoing a call by Campbell (2012), some works have provided a fuller account of citizens’ lived experiences with the state by examining how multiple policy experiences feed back into citizens’ political attitudes and behaviours (e.g. Bruch, Marx Ferree and Soss, 2010; Hern, 2019; Shanks-Booth and Mettler 2019; Rosenthal, 2021). Yet, departing from the prevalent focus on single policy experiences poses a series of challenges, including methodological challenges to standard research designs based on an a priori policy selection. Second, alongside a focus on individual-level feedback effects of experiences with the state, a few scholars have started to study the collective dimension of policy feedbacks, either at the level of specific social and racial groups (Garcia-Ros, Lajevardi, Oskooii and Walker, 2021; Simonsen, 2021) or generations (Svallfors, 2010; Dupuy, Verhaegen and Van Ingelgom, 2021). These studies theoretically redefine or expand feedback mechanisms by putting emphasis on their interpretive or normative component. However, the issue of how collective and individual-level feedbacks combine and are to be theorized is still largely unchartered. Third, attention is being directed towards contingencies within policy feedback effects. Here, scholars show that the political effect of policies often varies based on the characteristics of the recipients (e.g. Lerman and McCabe 2017; Michener 2019) and the contexts within which they are situated (e.g. Clinton and Sances 2017). Last, another path of further research, which cuts across the other three, is to move feedback studies on mass publics, a mostly US-based scholarship, to other policy contexts as recently suggested by Béland and Schlager (2019). A main issue is to assess how the results and theories about a submerged state and a targeting welfare state, as the US is sometimes depicted, illuminate European cases, where the welfare state is still largely universal (Bussi, Dupuy and Van Ingelgom, 2022), or African cases, where public service is patchy and developing (Hern, 2017) - thereby supporting further elaborations and developments in feedback studies on mass publics.",Jane R.

Featuring studies of national elections between 2020 and 2021, t will seek to understand how campaigners in a range of different contexts innovated with online tools (or not) in their attempts to mobilize voters during the Covid-19 crisis. Papers will address key questions of how far such adaptation is fundamentally rewiring and restructuring the way campaigns operate in a post-pandemic world. Is virtual the ‘new’ normal? Or will we see renewed value placed on in-person voter contact? Thematically, has Covid-19 lowered the bar even further to the exploitation of misinformation and conspiracy theory in campaign messaging? Finally, methodologically, how are scholars adapting to the post-pandemic environment to study GOTV activity. Papers will showcase new ‘hybrid’ methods of observing voters electoral ‘behaviour’ that link survey responses with online tracking data extracted from social media feeds. What are the new ethical and logistical challenges presented by these new highly personalised sources of information?

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 1: Political Thought and Philosophy,,September 15,pm,12:00,1:30,Jewish Political Thought: Classical Texts and Contemporary Democratic Challenges,"Though neglected for many years, Jewish political thought has become an increasingly important area of political theory with three distinct subfields: the historical study of how Jewish texts influenced European political thought, beginning in early modernity (Jones et. al. 2008; Nelson 2010); the interpretive examination of Jewish political ideas themselves, from the ancient world to the present (Berman 2008; Elazar 2017; Lesch 2019; Lorberbaum 2002; Melamed 2003; Morgenstern 2009; Walzer 2012); and the normative appraisal of Jewish political life today, including questions of identity, solidarity, and nationhood (Butler 2012; Cooper 2015; Gans 2015; Novak 2005).
Intersecting with each of these subfields, this panel will explore how a diverse array of classical texts in Jewish political thought, from the Hebrew Bible through the twentieth century, speak to key challenges in contemporary democratic theory and politics. At first this might seem surprising: How might a political tradition rooted in religion and developed largely without sovereignty provide insights into the democratic present? Yet as this panel will show, it is precisely due to its unique historical position—neither fully western nor non-western, neither straightforwardly political nor non-political—that classical Jewish thought offers us valuable theoretical resources which bear directly on the themes of APSA 2022: How can democratic citizens navigate multiple and conflicting claims to authority? Is equality an achievable political goal, and if so, in what form? What are the psychological underpinnings of populism, and do they lend themselves to tyranny? And how might liberal democracies respond when citizens elevate God’s kingship over majority rule?
In “The Democratic Potential in the Biblical Monarchy: Reading Authority with and against Spinoza,” Sarah Greenberg reinterprets Spinoza’s Theological-Political Treatise to locate concealed and counterintuitively democratic elements in the Hebrew Bible’s views on kingship. Where Spinoza reads authority as consistently hierarchical, Greenberg argues that the Hebrew Bible’s covenantal relationship creates a Jewish model in which authority is circulating and agonistic —what she calls “covenantal authority.” Reading covenantal authority into Biblical monarchy thus not only illuminates democratic practices in what was a seemingly non-democratic regime, but complicates and reconstructs our understandings of the relationship between covenant, authority, sovereignty, and obedience.
Building on these democratic elements, Mira Morgenstern’s “The Possibilities of Politics in Rousseau’s Lévite d’Ephraïm” explores a prose-poem by Rousseau about the Book of Judges to consider how we might integrate equality into a political system beset by complex challenges. Morgenstern analyzes both the form and function of Rousseau’s text, focusing on the status of re/interpretation, the role of literary format in imagining “out of the box” solutions to seemingly intractable problems, and Rousseau’s sophisticatedly-presented arguments about the ideal political state. Crucially, this includes Rousseau’s hidden critique of any political community which does not—or cannot—support the kind of state to which its philosophical claims seem dedicated.
Ronald Beiner’s paper “Freud’s Moses: Tyrant-Father of the Primal Horde,” turns our attention to issues of political psychology through an original reading of Freud’s text Moses and Monotheism. The extent of Freud’s obsession with Moses is beyond dispute: “The man, and what I wanted to make of him,” he once wrote, “pursues me incessantly.” But precisely what design Freud was pursuing in “what he wanted to make of him” is far less clear. Freud, Beiner argues, offers a picture of how Moses stands in relation to a national community which is highly charged with political implications. And while we cannot decipher all the enigmas of this riddlesome text, he concludes, we can tease out some of its more intriguing political elements.
Finally, Charles Lesch’s “The Human Hand of Divine Rule: Maimonides on Theocracy,” examines how medieval Judaism’s great rationalist philosopher conceived of the political implications of God’s kingship. First, God cannot be counted on to miraculously realize religiously-mandated values. People must do this themselves. Second, when people follow God’s will in the world, they are not simply choosing to do the right thing; they are functioning as agents of divine rule. Finally, politics plays a significant, even decisive, role in human affairs. Human beings must not only faithfully transmit and obey divine ordinances; they must actively ensure that God’s will is carried out. Given the resilience of theocratic states and movements, Lesch concludes, understanding theocratic thinkers like Maimonides is not only of scholarly interest, but of critical normative and practical significance for those committed to liberal democracy.",Andrew Rehfeld Hebrew Union College,"Andrew Rehfeld Hebrew Union College

Our model separates criminal transitional justice targeting low-ranking agents of repression from the prosecutions of leaders, who issue orders to repress. We show that targeting low-ranking agents of repression increases their incentives for supporting authoritarian backlash. We test our model's predictions using the Global Transitional Justice Dataset, which reports prosecutions over time and includes information on the rank of defendants. This information allows us to construct an original independent variable: the proportion of leaders that stood trial as a percentage of all criminal trials against former perpetrators, what we call the ``skewness of justice.'' Beyond correlations between democratic stability and skewness of justice, we also use detailed case studies of Argentina and Egypt to illustrate our argument and the mechanism at play.","Staffan I.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 11: Comparative Politics,,September 15,pm,12:00,1:30,Political Economy of East Asia,"In the post-World War II era, East Asian economies have taken turns leading the world in terms of speed of economic growth: Japan in the 1960s; the four Tigers (Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore) in the 1970s; the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in the 1980s; and China since the early 1990s. Collectively, East Asia grew faster than any other region in the world prior to the Asian financial crisis in 1997-1998. Despite the end of century upheaval, the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, East Asia remains a dynamic economic engine paced by China’s continued growth. East Asia has accumulated increasing wealth and economic power and has shifted from the “periphery” of the capitalist world economy toward its “core”. Through this process, East Asian economies have undergone important socio-economic transformations that have served as a weathervane to other advanced industrialized countries in the midst of globalization, rapid population aging, and deindustrialization. Hence, this region offers ample and diverse examples of how domestic politics in production, trade, finance, and social development interact with the global market forces and international institutions.
This panel examines the effects of profound structural changes facing East Asian countries in recent years—the COVID 19 pandemic, growing economic inequality and grievances towards the current form of globalization, and population aging. The four papers investigate various ways in which these specific structural changes shapes domestic politics, which is broadly defined as ranging from the macro level such as the developmental state (e.g., trade, industry, and public health policies) to the micro level such as public opinion (e.g., individuals’ trade policy preferences and support of the current political regime). Specifically, Wei-Ting Yen’s paper explains how pre-existing state-market relations account for the national variations in COVID-19 responses across Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. Seung-Youn Oh’s paper examines the changing dynamics of public-private partnerships of Korea, Inc. in navigating political and economic changes in the post-Global Financial Crisis period. On the micro level, ByeongHwa Choi and Yesola Kweon’s paper uses survey experiment data from Japan to show how demographic structures and age can reshape trade policy preferences in the context of population aging. Xian Huang and Cai Zuo’s paper employs Asian Barometer Survey data to explore two mechanisms (i.e., changes of political values and redistributive demands) through which perceived fairness of income distribution strengthens the popular support of the current political regime in 13 East Asian countries.
In their efforts to answer the central question about how the structural context influences domestic politics in East Asia, these papers also make use of diverse methodological tools. Some are detailed case studies based on careful process tracing and extensive archival works. Others utilize survey experiments, quasi-experimental approaches, and statistical analyses. The diversity in topics, country cases, data, and methods in this panel will contribute to the broader discussion of domestic responses to public health crises, globalization, population aging, and economic inequality in developed and middle-income developing countries.",Kristin Vekasi University of Maine,"Ji Yeon (Jean) Hong University of Michigan

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 12: Comparative Politics of Developing Countries,,September 15,pm,12:00,1:30,2019: Year of Revolutionary Potential,"The last pre-pandemic year witnessed an extraordinary number of uprisings. Large-scale protests and movements erupted in Iraq, Lebanon, Algeria, Hong Kong, Chile, Venezuela, Sudan, Albania, and many other places – in many cases, only to be cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. How did this global wave of protests compare to prior revolutionary waves – such as the Arab Spring, or the Color Revolutions? What kinds of demands and organizing formats were prevalent? How successful were these movements in provoking political and social change? And finally, how did the onset of the global pandemic and corresponding restrictions on assembly shape or constrain these movements in their later phases?
This panel brings together methodologically and regionally diverse papers that explore 2019 protests and movements from a micro- and mezzo-perspective. Berman, Clarke, and Majed use original event datasets to analyze mechanisms of revolutionary mobilization during the contemporaneous fall 2019 uprisings in Lebanon and Iraq, asking how the political context of a post-conflict democracy may shape mechanisms of mobilization and state response. Kadivar, Abedini, and Khani study the relationship between oil production and protest in Iran, also using original event analysis of November 2019 protests against gas price increases. Yuen and Cheng study “leaderful activism” during Hong Kong’s Freedom Summer of 2019, identifying transformations in the form and tactics of networked mobilization from earlier Hong Kong protests. Schwedler examines small protests in the context of 2019 Jordan, arguing that protests of a dozen or more participants merit theorization both in their own right and in the context of a broader contentious landscape.
Each paper is well-grounded in a country case study while drawing on comparative theory and scholarship. Together, these papers paint a complex picture of global mobilization in the last pre-pandemic year. Further, and in line with the 2022 APSA theme, these papers offer a perspective through which future scholars may analyze protests and movements emerging during and after the pandemic years, thus highlighting change and continuity for mass mobilization in the midst of a changing world.",Tomila Lankina London School of Economics and Political Science,"Diana Fu University of Toronto

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 12: Comparative Politics of Developing Countries,,September 15,pm,12:00,1:30,The Politics of Education and Training in Latin America,"Education is the most reliable long-term path for achieving inclusive and sustainable development. At the beginning of the 20th century, Latin American countries like those in the Southern Cone of South America, Costa Rica and Mexico led the developing world in terms of expansion of primary education. Yet, over the past 70 years, Latin America has lagged behind every competing region in terms of further expansion of educational attainment and quality.
The expansion of education is part of every government program attempting to reinvigorate political representation and empowering inclusion of the marginalized masses. It is the cornerstone of democratic values and citizenship formation across the region. However, as of today not even the most advanced or the most egalitarian countries in the region have succeeded in providing the masses with a minimum 12 years of solid education. At the same time, it is widely agreed that Latin America’s lack of a skilled workforce is one of the most daunting impediments to achieving higher levels of economic and social development. In fact, Latin Americans sit at the bottom of international tables of skills acquisition. While the relations between education, skills, and social and economic development are relatively clear and widely shared, there is an important gap in understanding the politics behind these relations in Latin America that we intend to fill.
This panel features four presentations that are part of a book project on the politics of education in Latin America. The book connects with broader and recent efforts in political science studying the politics of education and skills formation. Most of the recent contributions, however, have concentrated on advanced economies leaving behind the analysis of regions characterized by problems of overall low skills, of state capacity and of variation in institutional strength. The book intends therefore to understand the trajectory of education and skills formation in Latin America during the last thirty years and answer the following questions: Why did Latin American countries stagnate in terms of educational success? What explains their incapacity to improve the education of the masses despite sustained public interest and investment in education? What explains different trajectories between countries in the region and with countries in other regions at equivalent levels of development?
The four papers in this panel concentrate on diverse issues. Schrank aims to understand the diverse determinants of the diffusion of German TVET models in the region; Kosack revises whether the organization of the poor and the demands from employers explain educational expansion in post-Washington consensus Latin America (as they did during the XXth century); Díaz-Rios analyses the role of peripheral entrepreneurs in translating global ideas and influencing educational policy change during the commodity boom. Finally, Rangel studies the mechanisms through which firms interact with states and educational institutions in their attempts to generate human capital at the subnational level. Two of the papers analyze general education (Kosack and Díaz-Ríos) while the other two concentrate on vocational education and training (Schrank and Rangel); conversely, while two focus on diffusion processes of international experiences (Schrank) and policy agendas (Díaz-Rios), the other two focus on the organization of domestic actors (Kosack) and the specific relation between employers and the state (Rangel).
Overall, the four papers present diverse but complementary keys to understand the politics of education in post-Washigton Consensus Latin America.",Juan Ariel Bogliaccini Universidad Católica del Uruguay,"Ben Ross Schneider Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 13: Politics of Communist and Former Communist Countries,,September 15,pm,12:00,1:30,"COVID-19, Political Attitudes, and Government Support in Ukraine","The paper presented by Henry Hale, Olga Onuch, Gwendolyn Sasse, and Volodymyr Kulyk examines the effects of a major health crisis on electoral support. Are incumbents more likely to benefit from rallying induced by anxiety and uncertainty, or are they likely to be blamed for their management of the health threat? How does this rallying or penalty effect work out at different levels of government? Employing two original cross-sectional nationally representative surveys from Ukraine from April and October 2020, this paper finds that while there is evidence that individual-level uncertainty and fear around the pandemic resulted in a fragile rallying effect shoring up support for the national government and specifically the president (one that persists even as the crisis deepens), there is even stronger evidence of a COVID-19 penalty on incumbents at the local level. Their analysis shows that when concerns about COVID-19 and related policies were most pronounced, survey respondents reported a willingness to punish incumbent mayors in local elections. This finding maps on to precinct-level results and local COVID-19 case counts. The paper develops a theory as to why local politicians – who repeatedly flouted central government policy on lockdowns and other restrictive measures - were left more exposed in the pandemic context. They do so by placing the penalty effect in the context of the ongoing decentralization process taking place in Ukraine.
Graeme Robertson and Grigore Pop-Eleches present research on COVID-19, conspiracy, and trust in government in Ukraine. The Covid pandemic hit the world at a time when trust in institutions, such as the government and the media, was under threat across the world. The lingering effects of the global financial crisis, mass population movements, the spread of social media and deliberate disinformation campaigns had roiled the political space in emerging and long-standing democracies alike. The outbreak of a global coronavirus pandemic in early 2020 was a dramatic new addition to an already precarious situation. Theoretically, the pandemic could have multiple effects. Given the inability of nation-states to protect their citizens from illness and even death, and the tremendous uncertainty introduced by a novel virus, the pandemic threatened to undermine further the fragile faith in political institutions, the media, and even democracy itself. On the other hand, given that fighting the virus would require coherent state action, it is also possible that the pandemic could lead some citizens to turn more to their institutions and political system. To unpack these issues, they use panel data collected in Ukraine before and after the global pandemic of 2020-21. They focus on how anxiety and other emotions, as well as preexisting political preferences shaped how citizens’ trust in institutions and commitment to democracy was affected by the onset of the pandemic in Ukraine and draw comparative lessons to be tested in other contexts.
Irina Soboleva and Tymofii Brik explore the causal effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on local and national identities in Ukraine. Prior research suggests that common threat intensifies one's connection to their in-group, but less research is done on the relative changes of various identities over time. Leveraging three-year panel data from Ukraine and a series of survey experiments, they demonstrate that individual compliance with COVID-19 preventive non-pharmaceutical measures (wearing face masks, self-isolating at home during the lockdown, etc.) intensifies the individual sense of belonging to their nation while leaving other identities intact. Moreover, the effect of compliance on national identity is reciprocal, and individual identification with any geographic entity is associated with improved compliance with government policies a year later. Specifically, the increase in national, European, and global identities has the strongest effect on individual policy compliance over time. They further explore individual- and societal-level predictors of identity changes and identify the conditions under which individual identities can be used to improve compliance with preventive measures and policy guidelines.
Finally, using the case of Ukraine’s 2013-2014 Euromaidan, Emma Mateo addresses the question of why, during moments of nationwide mass mobilization, protests are repressed in some towns and cities but not in others. Why does repression sometimes have different effects within the same region? Her paper investigates how local political context shapes regional repression and its influence on protest. Using process tracing, Mateo compares otherwise similar cities from the same macro regions, with the crucial exception of local political dynamics. She argues that local political context mediates the relationship between repression and protest in that repression suppresses, rather than triggers more protest, in cities where local political elites have stronger ties to the ruling regime.",Irina Soboleva Duke Kunshan University,"Katerina Tertytchnaya University College London

Despite his criticisms of the Trump tariffs during the campaign, President Biden has not backed away from the use of the tariffs as a means of confronting China’s unfair trade practices. How has the trade war affected US-China trade and investment relations? How did the public in both countries react to the trade war? Have American firms been able to successfully resist the trade war by requesting exclusion from the tariffs? The papers on this panel collectively address these important questions. Through a comparison of individual trade preferences in China and the United States, Bulman shows that security framing of the bilateral relationship has had different effects on the American and Chinese public’s attitudes toward the trade war, highlighting the variation in the salience of the commercial peace in democratic versus authoritarian regimes. Lee and Osgood examine the process of tariff exclusion in the United States and assess the relative importance of political factors versus the more neutral administrative criteria for granting relief in shaping firms’ ability to secure tariff exclusions. The papers by Kim and Zeng and Liang, Shi, and Hu in turn direct attention to Chinese firms’ reactions to the trade war. While Kim and Zeng focus on the extent to which the trade war, along with the Chinese government’s push for the “dual circulation strategy,” has prompted Chinese firms to direct investment inward through backshoring, Shi et al. examine the survival of Chinese exporters through firm-level data. Taken together, this set of papers highlight the processes and consequences of this large-scale commercial conflict and help to illuminate the factors that influence its evolution at both the individual and firm levels.",Robert Gulotty The University of Chicago,"Robert Gulotty The University of Chicago

This panel seeks to think afresh about how to understand and explain why some citizens and elites support international processes and organizations more than others. The panel is coherent in focus, but diverse in theoretical starting points, methods, and empirics. Its productive combination of papers promises significant advances in our understanding of the factors and conditions shaping public opinion on international cooperation.
Theoretically, the papers develop a rich set of explanations, ranging from economic concerns to social identity, political ideology, and political awareness. Methodologically, the papers present novel survey and experimental data, varyingly focusing on specific countries (Israel, Georgia) and on a broad range of diverse countries in multi-country designs. Empirically, the papers cover several international issues and processes, from the legitimacy of international organizations to state memberships in and withdrawals from such organizations, as well as international donor influence.
A first paper explores the relationship between political values and legitimacy beliefs toward international organizations in a broad range of countries. A second paper focuses on attitudes toward membership in international organizations, focusing on the drivers of membership preferences in Georgia. A third paper turns to the opposite question, examining attitudes related to withdrawals from international organizations, focusing on Israeli opinions toward organizations subject to US withdrawal. The fourth paper examines the opinions among aid experts on the political influence of international aid donors in a broad setting.","Ryan Brutger University of California, Berkeley",Stefanie Walter University of Zurich,"The Missing Link: How Political Values Matter for Global Legitimacy Beliefs - Matthias Ecker-Ehrhardt, Universität Duisburg-Essen; Lisa Dellmuth, Stockholm University; Jonas Tallberg, Stockholm University

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 19: International Security,,September 15,pm,12:00,1:30,Rethinking Nuclear Arms Control,"What political arrangements are necessary to prevent a nuclear war? Nuclear technology changed international politics. Nuclear energy promised to reduce the costs of industrialization, especially for developing countries. However, the destructive potential of nuclear weapons surpassed the limits on the use of force that the international order offered. The possibility of global destruction became evident during the Cuban missile crisis, when the United States and the Soviet Union were on the brink of nuclear war in October 1962. Since then, the prospects of nuclear Armageddon have forced international society to build political arrangements to prevent conflict and guarantee security in a nuclear context. A series of agreements limiting the development and potential uses of nuclear weapons emerged alongside and as part of strategic dialogues among the main nuclear players during the Cold War. These elements constituted nuclear arms controls promoting stability and international security. Nowadays, the world in which these treaties were created and the conditions and goals they strived for no longer exist, including intensifying tensions among nuclear powers, slow disarmament rates, and calls to increase the number of countries with nuclear arsenals. In response, nuclear deterrence and nuclear disarmament advocates alike portray their causes as the best tools to prevent large-scale nuclear wars among great powers. In contrast, this panel proposes to rethink nuclear arms control as an alternative path to guarantee security from nuclear weapons. This panel explores past and present pathways to reduce the dangers of nuclear war through multilateral nuclear arms control agreements. We propose to examine: what is regulated in nuclear arms control agreements, what is not included in these mechanisms, and how to verify controls.",Fiona Cunningham University of Pennsylvania,Arturo Sotomayor George Washington University,"Thinking beyond the Nuclear Realm: Missile Defenses and the Arms Control Regime - Sanne Cornelia J.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 2: Foundations of Political Theory,,September 15,pm,12:00,1:30,Democracy Outside the Legislature,"The emergence of modern democracy gave rise to two great debates. The first was about the legitimacy of democracy. Should the people really rule? The second was about the location of democracy. If the people are to rule, where and how should this occur?
This panel takes up the second of these debates. In particular, it considers a series of theorists and movements who asked whether democracy should take the form that would come to be called ""parliamentary democracy."" To what extent does genuine popular government require power and decisions to be located outside the legislature?
The papers by Adam Lebovitz and Lucia Rubinelli consider pivotal moments when the proponents of popular and legislative politics confronted each other. Lebovitz's paper examines the struggle between the Jacobins and the Girondins during the French Revolution over the legitimacy of ""direct action"" by the people. Rubinelli's paper examines how republican and socialist theorists turned to extra-legislative forms of politics following the 1848 revolution. The papers by William Selinger and Gregory Conti further complicate the issue by considering important theorists who turned to institutions or practices that were seemingly in conflict with legislatures, but who did so because they believed this was necessary to salvage or empower legislatures. Selinger looks at Alexander Hamilton's conception of the judicial power; Conti examines A.V. Dicey's writings on the referendum.
With this panel we intend to make three interventions. First, we will show that there are important continuities between contemporary democratic theory (with its longstanding emphasis on participatory democracy, judicial power, popular protest movements) and older debates in the history of political thought. Second, we will complicate the notion that modern political thought was defined by the triumph of representation--in fact, the victory of parliamentary or representative democracy, emphasized by Bernard Manin and others, was less complete and more contested than is often realized. Third, we will suggest that the question of where democracy is to be located is a fruitful one for analyzing many of the struggles of our current political moment.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 2: Foundations of Political Theory,,September 15,pm,12:00,1:30,Rethinking Equality,"A legacy of Stoicism, theorized in 17th c. social contract theory, and enshrined in the US Declaration of Independence’s “self-evident” “truth” that “all men are created equal,” the idea of equality as a kind of sameness, given by nature, God, or reason, somehow inherent in human beings from birth, has tremendous staying power. This idea of equality, as a “basic” or “moral” given, also, however, harbors inegalitarian dangers. Our panel explores the development of the modern idea of equality, its inegalitarianisms, and ancient, early modern, and contemporary alternatives to it.
Anne Phillips, London School of Economics, “Equality and hierarchy: why ‘moral equality’ is so unhelpful”
In the ‘modern’ conception of equality, we qualify as equals by virtue of our possession of some specified ‘human’ qualities. Historically, this prototype human has managed to exclude women, indigenous peoples of the Americas, Africans, Asians, among others. The current language of moral equality claims to include all, but the exclusionary history continues in the preoccupation with justifications for equality. Justification sets conditions, and always leaves open the possibility that some humans will fail. Moreover, the moralized language, further elucidated through notions of dignity, worth, and respect, allows for slippage from assertions of equality to judgments of relative worth. Implied contrasts between ‘moral’ and material equality also encourage the belief that societies already agree on the first, and only differ over what to do next. Against the supposed consensus on basic equality, I examine how historical hierarchies of gender, caste, and race interact with newer hierarchies of education and intelligence.
Jill Frank, Cornell University, “Geometric Equality”
Preserving equality as a moral given while acknowledging differences, philosophers argue for treating people not equally but “as equals” and for allocating resources “in proportion” to differing circumstances, skills, and experiences. Rightly critical of how some such scholars theorize such allocations, advocates of “democratic equality” tend to prioritize “relational” over distributive concerns or to replace equality with equity. Arguing for co-implication across distributions and relations, I turn to Aristotle, who harnesses equity to equality in his account of distributive justice. Guided by “geometric” equality, Aristotelian distributive justice treats equality as not given but made, achieved not in spite of but in light of difference. If, in the ancient world, geometric equality inscribed differences sanctioning enslavement and misogyny, I argue, in dialog with dissenting opinions of US Supreme Court Justices in recent cases on education and voting, that it repays advocates of democratic equality to revisit Aristotle on geometry and/in distributive justice.
Teresa M. Bejan, Oxford University, “Peers and Equals”
Modern “basic equality” is a normatively egalitarian idea: those who are equal should, as a matter of justice, be treated as equals. Yet the idea that every human is “equal” is an ancient one consistent with hierarchies of all sorts. I argue that “basic equality” became normatively egalitarian in early modern England through its insinuation with another idea—parity, understood as an aristocratic relation of shared value among English Peers. I suggest that loss of the distinction between equality and parity in modern English explains why the equality-talk of post-Rawlsian political philosophy so often confuses rather than clarifies, and explore the conceptual and normative implications of understanding basic equality as a matter of parity and not strict equality.
Ainsley LeSure, Brown University, “Equality + Reality”
Leading Black studies scholars maintain that Western political ideals are a dead end for black freedom: Saidiya Hartman claims that the humanistic ideal of equality serves to secure black subjugation; Frank Wilderson premises Black world-making on ruining the unethical anti-Black world; Fred Moten claims black people should refuse the political and embrace the social. Maintaining that Black freedom needs politics as a tool in its arsenal for world-making, I argue that in its mobilization of a universalist equality for the purpose of domination the West violates reality, that is, reality in the phenomenological sense, as what we know about the world we share in common through the sensorial capacities of our bodies in relation to other bodies and actual objects. I argue further that the abandonment of politics Hartman, Wilderson, and Moten promote abandons reality too, insofar as they allow white supremacy to set the terms for Black existence. As an alternative, I articulate an account of equality that respects reality by restoring the permanence of Black agency.",Robert Gooding-Williams Columbia University,Christopher Lebron,"Equality and Hierarchy: Why ‘Moral Equality’ Is So Unhelpful - Anne Phillips, London School of Economics

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 21: Conflict Processes,,September 15,pm,12:00,1:30,"Political Consequences of Violent Crime: Blame Attribution, Demanded Remedies","The study of how experiences of violence and crime shape political attitudes and behavior has captured increased attention in recent years (e.g., Bateson 2012; Berens and Dallendörfer 2019; Brooks 2014; García Ponce et al. 2018; Ley 2018; Masullo and Morisi 2020; Nussio 2019; Visconti 2019). While much has been learned from these studies, evidence remains mixed, and some core findings even contradict each other. This panel aims to overcome existing limitations and push forward this scholarship by bringing together papers that (a) go beyond generic understanding and measurements of violence and crime and (b) focus on better specified political outcomes that have not been the stock-in-trade of the literature to date.
More concretely, the panel explores the drivers of citizens’ justifications of crime and blame attribution as they relate to the perpetrator’s socioeconomic status and ideological identity. It also analyzes the factors shaping public support for harsher punishment for perpetrators, and the circumstances under which people seek solutions to the crime problem from the state or support extralegal justice.
Gabriella Levy (Duke University) explores whether the identity of the perpetrator matters in assessments and responses to victimization. She qualifies existing findings regarding the effect of victimization on support for iron fist approaches, showing that preferences towards harsh punishment and blame attribution depend on whether citizens dislike the victimizer. Similarly, Omar Garcia Ponce (George Washington University) and Isabel Laterzo (University of North Carolina), exploring variation in perpetrator characteristics, identify that the socioeconomic status of the perpetrator and its type of criminal involvement influence assessments of blame for both the perpetrator and government. Krzysztof Krakowski (Collegio Carlo Alberto), Juan Masullo (Leiden University), and Davide Morisi (Collegio Carlo Alberto) turn to variation in the type of crime. They contend that quotidian crime and organized crime, which often coexist in the same context, affect political preferences in different ways, particularly attitudes towards the state and strategies to combat crime. Finally, Sarah Berens (University of Innsbruck) explores whether crime risks affect distributive preferences in ways that other risks don’t. She shows that, unlike other risks, risks associated with violent crime decrease support for more generous social protection programs.
Beyond their substantive focus, the papers in this panel also share a common methodological approach and geographical focus. All four studies draw on survey experiments, in some cases in combination with other methods, and examine these issues in various countries in Latin America, a region particularly affected by crime.
The panel will be Chaired and Discussed by two outstanding scholars who have established and pushed the boundaries of this research agenda in the past and are currently producing cutting-edge research in the field: Regina Bateson (University of Ottawa) and Gemma Dipoppa (Stanford University).",Krzysztof Krakowski Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Gemma Dipoppa Brown University

The intellectual interchange between these two perspectives will improve our understanding of how repression works and how policy intervention could curb the abuse of state power. Findings proposed in the panel provide dynamic and fine-grained insights into the scholarship of repression and conflict processes.
The first project assesses whether judicial decisions contain excessive violence by state agents in the context of the US, where police officers' usage of electronic control devices (ECD) was unevenly constrained by decisions of the Courts of Appeals. The second research explores how the intersection between partisanship and exposure to violence affects citizens’ trust in coercive state institutions like police and army in post-conflict societies. The third project exploits a close-election regression discontinuity design to investigate the effect of legislative incumbency on electoral repression. The authors emphasize that the effect of incumbency on electoral violence depends on various institutional contexts such as electoral systems. The fourth research studies whether shaming of state repression by NGOs can improve a country’s condition of human rights. The authors stress that shaming should be treated as dyadic interactions when assessing its impact on human rights violations.
Together, these four projects facilitate scholars’ understanding of the political logic of repression at both the country level and subnational level, offering a more comprehensive landscape of repression studies. The contexts studied cover not only conflict-prone developing countries but also advanced democracies, exploring the generality of findings. The findings also yield important policy implications to curb excessive use of state violence.",Howard Liu University of Essex,"Pearce Edwards Carnegie Mellon University

The existing literature has widely debated the institutional design requirements for post-war stability and peace, but less the role of former rebels and revolutionaries in the social orders that emerge in the aftermath of violent conflict. While some studies have analyzed how insurgents reintegrate into social, economic, and political life once a conflict is over, fewer consider when such measures end conflict for good. To overcome these shortcomings, the papers prepared for this panel carefully trace combatant organizations’ evolution during wartime and into the post-war period. They challenge existing conceptualizations of social revolution and civil war; leverage new data on rebel reintegration; and develop new frameworks for the study of conflict recurrence. The papers broaden the analysis of war-to-peace transitions by examining how wartime legacies, revolutionary repertoires, and insurgent organizational structures impact the transformation of social orders in the post-conflict period. In doing so, they help to explain why rebels and revolutionaries sometimes successfully integrate into post-conflict politics, economies, and society, while at other times they remain precluded from participation in the post-conflict state.",Aila M.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 26: Law and Courts,,September 15,pm,12:00,1:30,"Contestation, Litigation and Climate Change","Intended or not, climate change contestation and innovation are increasingly shaped by activists and legal institutions. As advocates and opponents alike are frustrated with political stalemates found in the halls of parliaments and legislatures and at the treaty negotiation table, courts at the sub-national, national and international level as well as global governance institutions are increasingly home to climate change contestation and litigation – incrementally expanding the diversity of venues for legal innovation and reform. Understanding this expansion in the role of rights, legal activists and judicial institutions in shaping climate change norms and policies has never been more important.
One dominant response to this trend celebrates legal institutions and global norm makers as filling a governance gap and offering another avenue for voices that are often left out of policy debates. Alternate research warns of the limitations of court led reforms. While there is a robust history of environmental legal activism in the United States, we know much less about climate change legal mobilization and the new forms it is taking, be it at the local, state or national level in the US, or at the regional or international level across the globe. Increasingly we see a growing trend in climate change legal activism spreading across national jurisdictions including the US, Australia, Canada and at the international level in Europe. This panel explores the dynamics of contestation and litigation in shaping climate change reforms across a broad range of geographical jurisdictions. Papers include an exploration of the power of global norm makers in institutionalizing a nexus between climate change and human mobility in the United Nations and another paper problematizes the role of nonstate actors and international courts, all engaged in shaping the larger net of norms and rights applied to climate change harms. Panel papers also examine US strategic litigation in greater depth including a paper theorizing nationwide integrated litigation campaigns utilizing the case to stop coal production, distribution and usage and a final paper analyzing state courts in the adjudication of damage claims involving climate related disasters. The role of these legal actors and institutions in climate change policy has led to bold changes. These are radical moves given the political contention that surrounds climate justice debates and the equally tenuous position legal institutions hold as law makers.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 35: Political Organizations and Parties,Related Groups / Campaign Finance Research Group,September 15,pm,12:00,1:30,Money in Politics and Representation in Elected Officials,"The money used in U.S. election campaigns has almost doubled during the four years between the 2016 and 2020 election cycles. While money may not be the sole determinant of election results, candidates have difficulty competing in races without cash. Is the ever-rising need for campaign money distorting representation in terms of both ideology and descriptive representation? The four papers in this panel explore both the money primary and institutional impact of changing campaign landscapes to explore the relationship between money and representation.
Jake Grumbach and Adam Bonica, in How Early Fundraising Keeps Candidates of Color Out of Office, shed light on how the money primary deters racial representation in elected officials. The racialized system of money in politics in the U.S. presents a disproportionate barrier for prospective candidates of color to enter politics, especially because success depends on raising early money from professional networks, especially in the legal profession. Bonica and Grumbach construct a dataset on congressional candidates' educational and professional backgrounds and racial identities between 2010--2014. Their analysis demonstrates how the American campaign finance system is biased against racial minorities as they are historically excluded from elite educational and professional networks that are critical in showcasing viability.
Rachel Porter and Sarah Treul, in Ideological Giving & Amateur Success in Congressional Elections, explore the role of PAC money in the success of primary candidates who are political amateurs. Today, the U.S. House of Representatives comprises more political amateurs than ever, and electoral determinants of this phenomenon are not yet well analyzed. Using data from 2004-2020, Porter and Treul demonstrate that amateur candidates' recent successes in congressional elections have coincided with a rise in campaign donations from out-district donors and interest groups. More specifically, PACs with an ideological focus have shifted their giving behavior away from candidates with political experience, favoring political amateurs instead.
Zachary Albert and Raymond La Raja ask the following question in The Institutional and Representational Effects of Small Donor Democracy: how does the influx of small-dollar money into politics affect American political institutions and their ability to support broad democratic representation? Albert and La Raja explore the institutional and normative effects of increased small donor involvement using a mixed-methods approach. First, the paper explores whether small donors allow fringe candidates to do better than they otherwise might have and whether they efficiently target strategically important candidates in tough races. The authors also examine the power of small donors relative to traditional sources of influence within party coalitions as well as the legislative and governing patterns of candidates who rely heavily on small-donor support.
Finally, in National Campaign Resources and Nationalized Campaigns, Kenneth Miller explores why candidates within each party appear to be increasingly similar to one another across states and districts. While nationalization has been traditionally attributed to Southern realignment and the decline of local news, Miller theorizes that campaigns communicate to voters across districts with increasingly similar messages because the authors and financiers of the messages are increasingly the same. The paper tests the expectation that as outside advertising from national actors increases in a campaign, the issue content of that campaign becomes increasingly similar to the average campaign content for all of that party's candidates.",Jay Goodliffe Brigham Young University,Jen Heerwig SUNY-Stony Brook,"How Early Fundraising Keeps Candidates of Color Out of Office - Jake M Grumbach, Princeton University; Adam Bonica, Stanford University

In this panel, we explore how different incentive structures and local institutions affect conservation outcomes. Cesar Martinez Alvarez explores the case of Mexico, where he studies the effects of the implementation of a large-scale titling program which regularized land rights on deforestation and intra-community cooperation. Ella Bayi studies the incentives of Latin American countries to adopt protected areas for land conservation, exploring the effect of norm diffusion and economic incentives on PA creation. In Brazil, Kathryn Baragwanath studies the effects of economic interest groups on the enforcement of environmental rules. She finds that municipalities containing mines have systematically higher levels of deforestation when the mayors in office are linked to mining companies through campaign finance donations, previous occupations or to a pro-extractivist party. These findings suggest that there is capture of local institutions: extractive companies “buy” political favors from mayors by offering campaign donations, which in turn lead to lower monitoring and enforcement of environmental rules around mines. At the individual level, Tara Grillos exploits experimental evidence to show that market-based interventions can help stimulate the creation of local self-governance institutions, and once these institutions are in place they have the potential to produce stable institutional incentives for local people to work together. Together, this set of papers sheds light on the incentive structures which can help develop better institutions for land conservation efforts.",Luke Sanford Yale University,Xun Cao Penn State University,"Access to Secure Land Titles and the Stewardship of the Commons in Mexico - Cesar B.

The Chinese state has shown a sophisticated approach to managing and leveraging social media for ideological conformity and political support. The tactics, however, are divergent. Through examining the Chinese state’s informational repression strategy, social media content such as bottom-up propaganda, and Chinese celebrities’ political signaling, this panel offers a close look at how propaganda and ideologies are (re)produced in the online public discourse. Using government documents and series of online experiments, Blake Miller finds that careful and covert information control, when paired with targeted repression, can mitigate the threat of virality on social media while also limiting backlash and chilling effects that can result from heavy-handed censorship. Using computer vision and automated text analysis to analyze a novel dataset of 5.7 million videos from over 20,000 regime-affiliated accounts on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, Yingdan Lu, Jennifer Pan, Xu Xu, and Yiqing Xu find that the Chinese state mobilizes tens of thousands of regime-affiliated organizations through flat-rate and tournament incentives to create and spread propaganda content and compete for audience attention. Content analyzing over 415,000 posts on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, Dan Chen and Gengsong Gao find that the Chinese state has captured the most influential Chinese celebrities, primarily those popular with the younger generations, to more broadly promote its political agenda by leveraging celebrity influence on social media. Together, these papers use innovative research methods and novel data sources to paint a nuanced and complex picture of the Chinese state’s current approach to social media.","Haifeng Huang University of California, Merced","Haifeng Huang University of California, Merced

Full Paper Panel,NA,"Division 41: Politics, Literature, and Film",,September 15,pm,12:00,1:30,"Political Theory beyond the Text: Film, Folksongs and Music","Over the past 30 years, the sense of what constitutes political theory, its proper methods, and its preferred interlocutors and genres, has been revised by scholars interested in thinking about broader cultural practices in relation to politics. These scholars have developed political theory not by analyzing academic texts only but by considering, in addition, novels, plays, films, songs, cookbooks, dancing, and/or other practices that complement text-based traditions. This panel brings into dialogue a diverse array of scholars – whose work is geographically, methodologically, and historically diverse – seeking to push the bounds of political theory by using some of these alternative modes to help theorize the political.
The panel begins with two papers concerning music. First, Leigh Jenco (London School of Economics) explores early modern Chinese approaches to folksongs, oral poetry and vernacular literature, which indicate a specific aesthetic sensibility related to the capacity for moral realization and judgement, contrasting these with early modern European approaches to non-elite literature and indigenous practices. Rebecca LeMoine (Florida Atlantic University) then examines music as a means of theorizing about and negotiating cultural identities and cross-cultural relations in the ancient Mediterranean. Continuing the historical analysis but now shifting the focus to France, Davide Panagia (University of California—Los Angeles) considers the anglophone reception of French postwar political theory and shows how French scholars’ reaction against the French educational system shaped the kind of theory they produced and the aims they had for it. Katherine Goktepe (Yasar University), also concerned with the postwar era but this time solely in the United States, probes the link between sincere styles of representation in contemporary politics, Method acting, and madness using the films Sunset Boulevard (1950) and The Misfits (1961).
With Emily Beausoleil (Victoria University of Wellington) serving as Chair and Nancy Love (Appalachian State University) and Kennan Ferguson (University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee) serving as discussants, this panel will bring together a range of scholars at different stages in their careers, each of whom theorizes the political through alternative modes.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 44: Democracy and Autocracy,,September 15,pm,12:00,1:30,Processes and Consequences of Democratic Subversion,"This panel examines different processes of democratic subversion and their political consequences. Collectively, the papers use multiple methodological tools to study these topics, including large-n datasets, migration data, interpretivist methods, focus groups, and experimental methods. The panel is also diverse in regional focus, examining democratic subversion around the world. In Latin America, Cohen studies the rise and success of invalid vote campaigns. Using an original dataset, she finds that these campaigns are reactions to democratic backsliding. They express citizens’ concerns about electoral manipulation, and their demands for high-quality democracy. The paper speaks to larger questions about how democratic erosion shapes political behavior. Crabtree and Davenport examine racial violence and its political legacies in the United States. They demonstrate the creation of predominately white communities in the American South following the forced migration of Black Americans, and examine its contemporary consequences for American politics. Their findings engage questions about racial authoritarianism, political violence, and the challenges for multiethnic democracy and political equality in the US. In Turkey, Över uses interpretivist methods to examine how the ruling Justice and Development Party’s (AKP) “politics of nationhood” and ideas about citizen insiders and outsiders facilitated journalistic decay. In turn, the weakening of Turkey’s free press – a core element of democracy – further contributed to the country’s democratic backsliding. Finally, Turnbull studies how election violence influences political participation in Nigeria. Using virtual focus groups and conjoint survey experiments, she finds that violence that targets political elites has no effect on voting behavior or other forms of political participation. In contrast, election violence that victimizes ordinary citizens motivates citizens to join a protest and contact their representatives as well as withdraw support in the voting booth from candidates accused of such acts. The findings speak to larger questions about how citizens respond to elite efforts to weaken and subvert democracy with violence. Collectively, the papers pursue important questions about democratic subversion with methodological rigor and facilitate cross-regional insights and discussion.",Nara Pavão UFPE,"Laura Gamboa University of Utah

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 52: Migration & Citizenship,,September 15,pm,12:00,1:30,"Immigration Policy and Bureaucratic Institutions, beyond Implementation","In the past fifteen years, political sciences and other disciplines researching immigration policy have rediscovered bureaucracies. Scholars are increasingly paying attention to the work of the bureaucracy in implementing policies for immigrants, showing again and again how the lived experiences of policy are contingent on bureaucratic discretion and street-level bureaucracies. Using historical records, researchers are also documenting how implementation and operational considerations end up transforming formal immigration policy from the ground up. Immigration studies’ vibrant rediscovery has thus focused, in large part, on bureaucracies as implementation venues ripe with discretion.
Other classical functions of the bureaucracy—advising and influencing elected officials, imagining and designing policies, initiating policy change and monitoring policy outputs—have not attracted as much research attention when it comes to immigration policy. The rare exceptions to this trend paint a much richer picture of the ways bureaucratic institutions as part of the immigration policy process. Freeman’s (1995) foundational political economy theory of modes of immigration policy presents the public service as being in a powerful position because of an informational advantage regarding the consequences of immigration. Boswell’s (2009) account of the use of research in EU immigration policy—making demonstrated that administrative agencies act strategically to gain legitimacy as part of intergovernmental immigration policy development. Ellerman’s (2009) account of the politics of deportation showed that bureaucratic influence on immigration policy will vary in type and intensity according to the stage of the policy process. Work on immigration policy networks has documented that the public service is a central actor in developing links with stakeholders, outside of the presence of elected officials (Somerville and Goodman 2010). Insight from this research demonstrates the multiple ways in which bureaucracies can intervene in immigration policy and calls for richer engagement with these institutions from immigration scholars.
This panel explores how bureaucratic institutions impact immigration policies beyond implementation. Based on a dialogue comparative analysis, it has three objectives: 1) to document instances of bureaucratic impact on immigration policies in different national settings; 2) to identify mechanisms and pathways through which bureaucratic and actors shape immigration policy outputs and 3) to reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of different theoretical approaches stemming from political science, migration studies and public administration to account for the impact of bureaucratic institutions on immigration policies. Papers in this panel contribute to this objective by analyzing immigration-related bureaucratic dynamics in Canada, Australia, Mexico, the United States, Ireland, the UK and Japan. Doing so, they explore the contribution of mid-level bureaucrats in the internationalization of immigration, policy learning by administrative agencies involved with asylum, the different ways bureaucracies deal and use immigration backlogs as well as the relationship between immigration agencies structures and national approaches to immigration.

Full Paper Panel,NA,"Division 54: Ideas, Knowledge, and Politics",,September 15,pm,12:00,1:30,The Ethics of Voting and of Being Informed,"What duties do democratic citizens have? Must citizens vote, or contribute to the upkeep of democracy some other way? Do they have a duty to be informed about politics? The papers on this panel address these questions among others about the ethics of voting and democratic citizenship. Each of these papers brings a nuanced, institutional conception of democracy to bear on common ideas about the duties of democratic citizens, and each asks whether these popular ideas should be defended, extended, or revised in light of sophisticated and realistic models of democracy.
In distinct ways, Kevin Elliott and Emilee Chapman’s papers argue for the existence of a duty to vote. Whether democratic citizens have a duty to vote, and what the basis of such a duty might be, have been hotly contested questions in recent democratic theory. Both Chapman’s and Elliott’s papers depart from the more abstractly philosophical and atomized approach to the analysis of political duties which dominates the field today in favor of a more systemic and institutional approach.
Chapman defends the “folk” view that there is a duty to vote because such a duty contributes uniquely to the realization of core democratic values. In so doing, she defends widely shared understandings of voting’s role in reconciling popular sovereignty, individual dignity, and political equality while also shoring up a democratic political culture. Elliott argues that citizens have a duty to vote as a function of their institutional role as electors in representative democratic systems, not as an extension of any moral duty, such as a duty of fairness.
One of the thorniest problems in the debate over the duty to vote is the “specificity problem:” do citizens have a duty to vote, or merely to contribute to the upkeep of democratic institutions in other ways? Brookes Brown’s paper defends the latter view. She rejects the duty to vote in favor of a more general duty for citizens to do their share of what she calls “civic work”—actions that support democracy, including but not limited to voting. Accounts like those of Elliott and Chapman would likely be mistaken, on Brown’s view, for erroneously singling out voting as a duty of democratic citizenship.
As the debate over the duty to vote has unfolded, it has become increasingly tied together with the question of whether citizens also have a duty to become informed in order to vote. Indeed, Ben Saunders contends in his recent Journal of Politics article “Against Detaching the Duty to Vote” that the two questions are strictly speaking inseparable. Chiara Destri addresses this question in her paper, arguing that citizens do not have a duty to vote, but rather to become informed before voting. Like Brown, Destri rejects that there is a duty to vote, but posits a different sort of obligation to that of Brown in its place.
The papers on this panel will allow the duty to vote, the specificity problem, and the duty to be informed to be explored together, as most scholars now believe they should be. Moreover, the contrasting views the papers develop set up a rich discussion of the underlying issues.",Melissa A. Schwartzberg New York University,"Julia Maskivker

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 6: Political Economy,,September 15,pm,12:00,1:30,The Political Economy of Congressional Influence over the Bureaucracy,"The United States Congress and the federal bureaucracy are interdependent. Congress needs the federal bureaucracy to provide expertise and to implement its policies. The federal bureaucracy relies on Congress for funding and for the legal authority to implement policy. However, legislators and bureaucrats may have different preferences, and both must cope with the challenges this creates. This panel would feature four papers that bring new data and new theoretical perspectives to understand congressional control over the bureaucracy.
Annie Benn identifies a hitherto underappreciated motive for oversight: contesting presidential unilateral actions. She uses new data on executive orders and congressional hearings to identify the conditions under which Congress can check unilateral presidential power through oversight.
Pamela Ban, Ju Yeon Park, and Hye Young You also study congressional hearings, but for a different purpose. Classic theories of legislative organization emphasize the role expertise makes in congressional policymaking, and bureaucrats have some of the expertise that legislators need to craft effective policy. Ban, Park, and You use the transcripts of congressional hearings to investigate when Congress tries to extract policy-relevant information from bureaucrats, how much information they get, and the quality of that information.
Maria Silfa turns from what happens in Congress to what happens in the bureaucracies that legislators are attempting to control. In her study of legislative rulemaking in the Environmental Protection Agency, she finds that when legislators and businesses comment in a similar manner during the notice-and-comment period, the final rule is more likely to reflect their input.
John Patty and Ian Turner, on the other hand, emphasize that Congress has limited tools with which to influence the federal bureaucracy, and the limitations of these tools lead to surprising results. For example, legislators who are opposed to the direction the agency plants to take policy may support increasing funding for that agency and legislators with contradictory policy preferences may agree on the ideal budget level for the agency.
These studies foreshadow noteworthy advances in understanding the complicated relationship between Congress and the executive branch, and putting these papers in conversation with one another could lead to even more discoveries. The empirical papers introduce data and results that could be used to test the predictions of the theoretical papers, and the theoretical papers provide new predictions that could inform the design and interpretation of the empirical papers’ results.",Christian Fong University of Michigan,"Sean Gailmard University of California, Berkeley

Across contexts, governments are estimated to lose over hundreds of billions of dollars in forgone tax revenue. This panel gathers four studies that analyze the origins and the consequences of this phenomenon, employing a variety of methodological approaches. In “Brains or Muscles”, Tomasi and Parmigiani formulate a formal model of taxpayer behavior to understand the choice to evade taxes across institutional settings, illustrating its observable implications with data on offshore wealth. In “Wealth Secrecy, Punishment, and Cooperation”, Chen and her co-authors leverage a laboratory experiment to shed light on the role of wealth secrecy for the effectiveness of peer punishment in solving free-rider problems in public good contributions with high inequality. In “(A)Voiding the Fiscal Contract”, Paci employs a survey experiment to understand the impact of tax noncompliance by the wealthy on public opinion and demand for progressive taxation.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 7: Politics and History,,September 15,pm,12:00,1:30,History in Political Science,"To what extent and how does political science use history to formulate research questions, test theories, and generate new arguments? What are the best practices for and difficulties in using historical sources (secondary and archival) for these purposes? This panel brings together methodological and substantive papers to explore these questions. The first paper by Bulutgil and Mylonas argues that political science as a field is not making sufficient use of historical sources given the comparative advantage of these sources in testing theories through empirical implications. The paper provides an overview of the use, strengths, and weaknesses of historical sources compared to other widely used data sources in political science. It then offers concrete guidance on how to test theories with observable implications on multiple categories (such as timing/sequence, actors, and counterfactual scenarios) with historical sources. The paper by Schenoni and Podestà compares historical counterfactual analysis (HCA), which uses a theoretical perspective to construct counterfactuals, with the synthetic control method (SCM), which adopts an empirical path for constructing counterfactuals. The authors proceed to propose a broader framework for counterfactual analysis that combines the two approaches. Adria Lawrence’s paper draws on historical evidence from French North Africa to analyze why colonized populations comply with foreign domination. In addition to offering substantively important findings on the use of violence in the colonial context, the paper also discusses how to interpret primary sources from the colonial era, which only provide a partial view of how conquered populations reacted to foreign rule. Deborah Boucoyannis joins the panel with a paper on the uses of historical sources in the study of institutions based on her extensive research on the role of courts and the origins of representative systems in Europe.","Amel F.

Dwinger examines why authoritarian regimes allow opposition leaders to engage in open (and often critical) questioning of autocrats’ policies, arguing that ambiguity over the autocrats’ tolerance of public criticism reduces incentives for civic unrest. Correa, Nandong and Shadmehr study the conditions under which citizen grievances generate public protests against a regime, arguing that protests are more likely when grievances are caused by sudden, large events rather than an accumulation of smaller events.

Poltoratskaia first examines the factors influencing the electoral preferences of United Russia voters. The paper finds that UR voters are most motivated by particularistic benefits. Greene then examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on regime support in Russia, finding that hardship and emotion shift political views. Next, Hakimov investigates the transnational movement to monitor Russia’s 2021 State Duma elections. This study of the Russian diaspora provides an interesting contrast to public opinion and electoral support of citizens inside Russia. Finally, Vatansever examines the persistence of energy subsidies in Russia, with a particular focus on public support for these policies. In sum, these papers shed light on levels of regime support (or opposition) in electoral authoritarian Russia.","Ora John Reuter University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee",Margarita Zavadskaya University of Helsinki,"Assessing Electoral Preferences of United Russia Voters - Viktoriia Poltoratskaia, Central European University

One of the most important themes in comparative politics over the last three decades has been the gradual decline of political parties as effective vehicles to link citizens and the state in representative democracies beyond Election Day. Among the key catalysts for this diagnosis of crisis has been the organisational transformation of political parties, away from mass membership organisations rooted in civil society to increasingly professionalised entities inseparable from the state. While this transformation has profoundly influenced the empirical and normative direction of comparative research into the future of political parties, how political parties are themselves adapting to this transformation is not yet known. The papers in this panel will engage with one of the most significant empirical developments in parties across the globe: the transformation of opportunities for, and patterns of, affiliation with political parties as organisations. Both new and established parties claim to be inventing new forms of party membership and affiliation.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 1: Political Thought and Philosophy,,September 16,am,8:00,9:30,History and Political Judgment: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives,"Several key events in recent years – a financial crisis, the rise of populism, and a pandemic – have prompted comparisons and analogies with historical events, both in political discourse and in scholarly writings. For instance, the rise of populism during the past decade led many to point to structural similarities with the political situation of Europe in the 1930s (Snyder, 2018; Mounk, 2019). The ongoing pandemic encouraged a renewed historical interest into the Spanish flu and its consequences. Historical knowledge appears as one possible avenue to ground judgment on current situations. To what extent can the past be used as a source of justification for judgment and action?
In his Lectures on the Philosophy of World History, Hegel makes the following claim: “History and experience teach that peoples generally have not learned from history” (Hegel, 1822). He is not the first to question the normative potential of inquiries into the past; he participates in a movement that consecrates the rupture with the classical, Ciceronian topos of historia magistra vitae or history as a teacher of life (Cicero, 1995). History as a form of inquiry and mode of writing was considered for a long time as a “school of prudence”, as a reservoir of exemplars that would lead to better decision-making (Koselleck, 1979).
The break with this ancient conception of history raises questions about the foundations of judgment. In fact, the relationship between history and judgment remains today an ambiguous one. Should we expect moral and political guidance from history? If so, what form should this take? Can the past be “practical”, i.e. capable of answering the Kantian question “What shall I do?” What are the limits of a view of history as a teacher of lessons? What can the study of history tell us about the exercise of judgment? Are references to historical events, figures and writings merely used as rhetorical devices in political discourse? Can they serve a pedagogical or moral function?
Topics will include: Historical and contemporary perspectives on the relationship between history and political philosophy; the normative potential of historical knowledge; historical and contemporary theories on the formation and exercise of political judgment; comparative analysis of classical and modern conceptions of history.",Emma Planinc University of Notre Dame,"Ronald Beiner University of Toronto, Mississauga","Pseudo-Renaissances: On Hermann Heller's Interpretation of European Fascism - Jeffrey Andrew Barash, Université de Picardie Jules Verne

National budgets are constrained, political interests are entrenched, time horizons of diplomats and elected officials are short, and prioritizing adaptation is still often viewed as “admitting defeat” in the battle against climate change. While inadequate, analysts worldwide are devoting attention to mitigating harmful emissions, but international organizations, national governments, and subnational actors (be they local governments, private businesses, or non-governmental organizations) must contend with the increasing need to mainstream adaptation planning into climate change policy frameworks.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 11: Comparative Politics,,September 16,am,8:00,9:30,International Responses to China’s Global Presence,"Amid China’s increasing global presence, how do citizens of other countries formulate their views of China? Can China shape global public opinion through public diplomacy or economic exchange? Can foreign firms push back when the Chinese party-state seeks to use economic leverage for political goals? This panel will examine perceptions of and reactions to China’s global engagement from various perspectives. The papers shed light on foreign citizens’ views of China as well as how foreign actors respond to China’s economic power. Using a survey experiment, Pan examines the impact of digital public diplomacy and finds that positive tweets about China have a signiﬁcant positive effect on Americans’ attitudes toward China, whereas negative tweets about the US have little effect on their opinions. Ratigan finds that citizens’ views of China in Peru and Argentina are still very malleable and can be influenced by Chinese investment and other involvement in the region, although extractive projects may sometimes dampen enthusiasm for China. Wang and Zhu use experiments to show that positive or negative portrayals of Chinese people can influence Americans’ foreign policy preferences toward China and that US foreign policy rhetoric can likewise shape Americans’ views of Chinese people. Wang and Zhu’s research is among the first to examine the linkages between racial stereotypes and Americans’ foreign policy preferences toward China, thereby illuminating how foreign policy preferences are formed. In her analysis of economic conflicts between China and Japanese and Korean actors, Kellogg reveals how business can influence Chinese foreign policy, thereby limiting China’s ability to deploy its economic power for political ends. By examining how perceptions of China are shaped abroad and the extent of influence of China’s economic power, this panel advances our understanding of the broader implications of China’s global engagement.",Kristin Vekasi University of Maine,"Haifeng Huang University of California, Merced

This panel puts together a collection of papers that examine the nature of the church-state relationship—sometimes conflictual, sometimes cooperative—and its short- and long-run consequences for state building and political loyalties. The paper by Grzymala-Busse examines the role of the church in the fragmentation of the Carolingian Empire in the Early Middle Ages, giving rise to a constellation of new states and changing political loyalties that characterized the European state system in the centuries to come. The paper by Stavnskær & Møller examine the role of the church in the Crusades in the High Middle Ages, shedding light on the European bellicose tradition that contributed to state making in Western Europe. Fast forward, the paper by Amat examines the role of the Catholic Church in mediating between the government and political dissidents in recent military dictatorships, helping reduce overall levels of political violence. Lastly, Peisakhin and Queralt examine the persecution of Catholic leaders during Nazi Germany. A deliberate attempt by the Nazi regime to eliminate a competing form of social legitimacy backfired, forging long-lasting political Catholicism.

Recent research argues that the most developed economies are those where effective states can exercise an important productive role, such as providing an effective administration of justice and resolving coordination failures. And according to this view, the emergence of fiscal states is a fundamental condition for effective statehood. This requires transitioning from a state relying on resources derived from the monarch’s domain to a state where its resources come from the power to tax. A central part of such transformation is developing the administrative capabilities to raise revenues, i.e., acquiring fiscal capacity.
Historically, this process was pivotal to the transformation of the nowadays-advanced European economies, leading to the development of states capable of collecting revenues from a broad tax base and capable of effectively spending public funds on a range of good and services benefitting households and firms. However, it is less clear why we have not seen the same trajectory in less advanced economies, where states are much less effective and often taxation yields only a fraction of the revenues compared to rich countries. The papers in this panel will combine country case studies, cross-country econometric analysis and comparative historical analysis to examine the effects of fiscal states in low- and middle-income countries and its economic, political and historical determinants.",Kunal Sen UNU-WIDER,"Kunal Sen UNU-WIDER

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 12: Comparative Politics of Developing Countries,,September 16,am,8:00,9:30,Patronage and the Politics of the Public Sector,"Public sector jobs are an important political resource. Especially in developing contexts with weak civil service systems, they are one of the principal currencies with which politicians reward or incentivize supporters. However, abusing patronage is widely thought to have a detrimental effect on the quality of governance. As Geddes (1994) famously suggested, politicians and other elites face a dilemma: they must balance short-term patronage pressures with long-term development outcomes. Given that dilemma, when and how do states seek to constrain patronage? When they do, how successful are these policies and institutions?
This panel brings new data to the study of patronage in developing countries. The papers leverage large administrative or historical data sets from several important contexts: Brazil, India, Kenya, and China. First, Toral analyzes how anti-corruption policies in Brazil shape electoral cycles in the hiring and firing of bureaucrats. Second, Purohit and co-authors study how temporary suspensions of democratic rule in India affect the career prospects of particular groups of bureaucrats. Third, Russell and co-authors document a tension in Kenya between the patronage practices of local elected officials and centrally appointed bureaucratic managers. Fourth, Peng and Jiang amass new data on early personal appointments within the Chinese Communist Party to document the strategic use of factions within state organizations.

Rather than viewing policy outcomes as a straightforward reflection of power dynamics, the panel examines the manifold ways that politics and policymaking reshape one another over time. Exploring issues from gun control to trade policy, the papers investigate the conditions under which policies stimulate both positive and negative feedbacks in an era of hyperpolarization.
The first paper, “The Political Influence of City Employees: Civil Service Adoption in America,” by Sarah Anzia and Jessica Trounstine, examines the origins of one of the most important transformations in American government—the shift from patronage-based administration to civil service in municipalities. Leveraging a database on patterns of civil service adoption across 1,000 city governments, the authors show that a key engine behind this development was the local presence of an early occupational organization, the International Association of Fire Fighters. The paper provides new evidence of how interest-group power can not only change the allocation of public resources but also alter fundamental patterns of governance.
The next three papers turn to an exploration of backlash and counter-mobilization dynamics. In “The Politics of Policy Backlash in the U.S. Since 1960” Eric Patashnik examines the limits of positive feedback and increasing returns processes by exploring the conditions under which public policies activate or mobilize opposition among mass publics, organized groups, and political elites. Analyzing a database of more than 1,000 New York Times articles discussing backlash politics since 1960, Patashnik shows that backlash forces have diffused across U.S. policy arenas from civil rights to immigration over time, are associated with partisan polarization, and are predominately conservative in ideological direction.
In “Outraged Women: Gun Policy and Counter-mobilization in the US, 1980-2020,” Matthew Lacombe and Kristin Goss examine the emergence of a movement, driven by women, against the failure of policymakers to regulate firearms and curb the growing rights of gun owners. Drawing on an original dataset containing more than 4,400 letters to the editor published over a 40-year period, they show how political identities can emerge as a product of backlash in response to a changing policy environment.
Finally, Trevor Brown and Suzanne Mettler,” in their paper entitled “Public Policy and the Rural-Urban Political Divide,” examine the growing divide between how rural and urban areas vote and experience public policies. While voters in rural counties were only marginally more likely than their urban peers to vote for Republican candidates as late as the 1990s, the rural-urban partisan divide widened to a full 21 percentage points in 2020. Brown and Mettler merge individual- and county-level data on public opinion and political behavior to examine how social and careral policies as well as exposure to trade competition and war casualties shape political attitudes and voting behavior.",Matt Grossmann Michigan State University,"Chloe Thurston Northwestern University

Yet most of the existing research and knowledge on the topic is based on studies of developed countries, in particular the United States. This panel contains papers on Argentina, Brazil, India, and Pakistan. The papers in this panel have both descriptive evidence about the forms of misinformation in these countries and evidence about the causes and consequences of misinformation in the Global South.
Rossini et al. use data from Brazil to answer several questions about the spread of misinformation. They investigate whether visual misinformation is more credible and shareable in the context of instant messaging applications, which are widely used in the Global South, compared with public social media platforms. They then examine the differences in believing and sharing behavior depending on partisanship and digital literacy employing a variety of empirical strategies.
Batista Pereira et al, who also examine the case of Brazil, investigate the reasons for political elites to share misinformation. They first map the instances of misinformation among members of the political elites in Brazil, and document an association between online mobilization and sharing misinformation. Furtermore, they examine the effects of misinformation on citizens’ behavior and attitudes to measure the extent to which politicians can convert misinformation into mobilization.
Badrinathan et al, in coordinated experiments in India and Pakistan, look at the underexplored relationship between misperceptions about outgroups and vigilantism. Several recent events suggest the existence of an association, yet there several unanswered questions. Does misinformation play a direct role in motivating such vigilante actions? Are misperceptions sufficient to encourage violent action? Combining field experiments and descriptive evidence from two countries, Badrinathan et al advance our knowledge about these questions.
Arguete et al, examining Argentina, analyze the efficacy and what moderates the impact of a main tool against misinformation: fact-checking. Specifically, they investigate the reputational costs of adjudication. As credibility is critical for fact-checking agencies to be effective, this study sheds lights on the challenges to disseminate fact-checking as a tool against misinformation.",Ernesto F.

Democratic Prospects and Pitfalls in the Digital Age,"This panel explores the prospects for democratic governance in the digital age by drawing on political theory to both critique our current realities and formulate possible alternative futures. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the extent of as well as heightened our reliance on digital technology in the conduct of our professional and personal lives. Its increasing presence continues to raise pressing questions about governance, democracy, and privacy. Why does increased connectivity in the digital age coincide with increased experiences of social and psychological isolation? What expectations of privacy can we have when digital tracking and data mining are embedded in the profit models of tech companies? And what would alternative democratic digital infrastructures look like?
The disruption to daily routines and ways of being produced by the pandemic has also provided a kind of upheaval that may enable us to envision new normative horizons for addressing these longstanding and increasingly apparent questions and challenges. Political theory is well situated to help us interrogate these challenges; not just by emphasizing their roots in longstanding political problems, but also by assisting us in formulating new proposals in an instructive and normatively nuanced way. In this spirit, the papers on this panel draw from the work of a wide range of political philosophers and theorists to propose innovative models for reconceptualizing the structure, role, and purpose of digital technology - so that it becomes an empowering and connective, rather than isolating and oppressive, force in our lives.","Jennifer Forestal Loyola University, Chicago","Jennifer Forestal Loyola University, Chicago","Data-Owning Democracy: Citizen Empowerment through Data Ownership - Roberta Fischli, University of California, Berkeley

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 44: Democracy and Autocracy,,September 16,am,8:00,9:30,Authoritarian Practices: Internal and International Manifestations,"Recent research has called for a re-evaluation of how we study authoritarianism and its impacts, focusing not only the state as the unit of analysis, but rather conceiving of authoritarianism as a set of “practices” which are often transregionally facilitated. As such, this panel brings together papers discussing both international and transnational dimensions of authoritarian practices, disaggregating regimes to better understand and classify internal dynamics, as well as how the international and domestic interact to produce political outcomes. The papers included on this panel are methodologically diverse – from ethnographic approaches to statistical analysis - and focus on a number of regions and cases. Moreover, papers present new sources of data and novel measurement strategies, as well as address a variety of sites of authoritarian practices such as peace agreements and foreign aid arrangements.
The first paper, titled “Peace and Authoritarian Practices,” asks: how can peace initiatives reinforce authoritarian practices? It argues that peace can function to uphold, facilitate, and improve upon authoritarian practices under certain conditions. The paper uses the recent steps towards normalization and, in some instances, peace agreements between Israel and a number of Arab states to make this argument. These initiatives have facilitated authoritarian practices by necessitating the increase of state repression, fraying social ties, and expanding regime capacity through the acquisition of repressive technologies. By using ethnographic analysis and interviews across four Arab states with varying ties to Israel, this paper contributes to our understanding of authoritarian power and how it functions, transnationally and at varying levels within and outside state authority.
The second paper, titled “The Iron Fist and the Long Arm: Authoritarian Crackdowns and Transnational Repression,” builds on the emerging literature dealing with transnational repression, which has focused on the extraterritorial expansion of authoritarian states and identified several strategies used by such states to control and coerce their population abroad. Drawing on a unique database of nearly 1,200 cases in which authoritarian states threatened, attacked, extradited, or assassinated their citizens abroad between 1991 and 2019, the paper investigates the drivers of transnational repression. It argues that an increase in domestic repression is likely to increase incidents of transnational repression, as crackdowns at home drive dissent abroad and incentivize the state to extend its repression beyond its borders. This is the first quantitative test of correlates of transnational repression using new data.
The third paper, titled “Ruling Networks and the Consolidation of Power,” builds on the literature on dictatorial institutions and the potentially stable arrangements that characterize the relationship between leaders and other regime elites. The paper presents a two-dimensional conceptualization of a leader’s consolidation of power that is rooted in the absolute strength and centrality of elites and leaders within the ruling network. This conceptualization produces a typology with four unique ideal types: lineal consolidation, individual consolidation, power sharing and precarious stability. The plausibility of this conceptualization is subsequently examined through an exploration of the Syrian case from 1967 to the present. Finally, the paper provides a preliminary latent variable measurement strategy to capture elite-leader relations in authoritarian regimes.
Finally the fourth paper, titled “Performing Jordanian authoritarianism at home and abroad: Intervention, aid dependence and eternal reform,” challenges overly functionalist accounts of authoritarian persistence in the Middle East & North Africa region. According to such accounts, countries such as Jordan appear to be following an externally prescribed path towards liberal democracy, with the state being a largely passive respondent in an international relations arena shaped by others. Analyses of Jordanian authoritarianism, however, almost exclusively focus on the regime, and ignore the international dimension of authoritarian power. This paper challenges both accounts and calls for a stronger focus on the political agency that different (non-)state actors within the country and abroad demonstrate in generating authoritarian power. Using recent Jordanian initiatives, the paper explores how the state and authoritarian power are performed in a context of aid dependence, intervention and eternal reform. The paper shows how domestic and external actors work to include Jordanians as interactive consumers in the spectacle of dictatorship that hides behind a façade of constant transition.",Sean Yom Temple University,"Sarah E.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 44: Democracy and Autocracy,,September 16,am,8:00,9:30,Leader-Elite Power Dynamics in Dictatorships,"This panel explores the dynamics of leader-elite power balance and their implications in dictatorships using a variety of methodological approaches. Many existing studies have examined contentious politics between authoritarian regimes and society, identifying popular uprisings or opposition movements as the central threat to a dictator’s power. However, our understanding of intra-elite power dynamics and how leaders address the threats posed by regime elites is still limited. With that in mind, this panel aims to improve our scholarly understanding of this issue by, first, exploring what determines the variations in leaders’ decisions to promote or eliminate rival elites, and, second, by investigating the consequences of such leaders’ actions on the subsequent leader-elite power dynamics as well as the regimes’ abilities to protect them from regime change movements. Further, the panel reveals that leaders’ decisions on whether to promote or repress individual elites crucially depend on whether the individuals are (connected to) members of security apparatus, providing important implications for the literature on civil-military relations and comparative authoritarianism.
First, Grewal explores when a dictator’s security forces defend him from a mass uprising and whether security forces’ responses would be shaped by dictators’ strategies to weaken them via counterbalancing to prevent coups. In particular, Grewal explores the variations in military defection across junior and senior ranks using the original dataset, Armed Responses to Mobilization Or Revolution (ARMOR), that tracks how the military and police forces respond during every nonviolent regime change campaign included in NAVCO.
Second, Jost and Mattingly examine the promotion of party elites in autocracies. They argue that elite promotion hinges on an elite’s social ties to coercive institutions, especially the military, as the connections to the coercive institutions would improve an elite’s ability to mobilize their social network to challenge the leader through a coup. Specifically, they expect that prospects for promotion are highest when elites are well-connected to the autocracy’s coercive institutions but not so well-connected that it rivals those of the autocrats. They test their arguments by using an original biographical dataset that contains over 190,000 appointments to senior positions within the Chinese military between 1927 and 2014.
Third, Sudduth analyzes the dynamics of the leader-elite relationship by focusing on when and how dictators purge rival elites from the key positions in the regime. She argues that whether the targets of purges are military officers or civilian elites has a crucial impact on the subsequent leader-elite power balance. In particular, she claims whether a dictator can repress civilian elites and consolidate power depends on whether the dictator has already purged strong rival military officers, and thus the possibility of countercoups is low. She tests this argument using novel cross-national data on elite purges covering 118 authoritarian countries between 1980 and 2010.
Finally, Jiang explores how informal political constraints associated with leadership turnovers shape intra-elite power dynamics. He argues that aging leaders’ efforts to manage the succession problem create an important check on the power of subsequent leaders, and thus, incumbent leaders’ ability to consolidate power becomes more limited when operating in an environment where influential former leaders are present. They test this argument by using the massive text corpus of Google Ngram and developing a new quantitative measure of power for a global sample of autocratic regime leaders and elites between 1950 and 2019.",Jennifer Gandhi Yale University,"Jennifer Gandhi Yale University

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 48: Health Politics & Health Policy,,September 16,am,8:00,9:30,Behavioral Health Politics in the Subnational Context,"Behavioral health politics and policy literature is primarily confined to studies of payment models, most often through a national or in some cases federated lens. Yet, behavioral health policy and politics have a strong local and intergovernmental component: local governments and different compositions of non-profit and non-governmental organizations have been key providers of behavioral health services throughout the past century, with an increasing emphasis on devolution and delegation to non-governmental actors post-deinstitutionalization at the turn of the 20th century. With respect to substantive issues, behavioral health policy is also a highly varied and complex policy space working across different types of service provision and street-level bureaucrats in substance use services and psychiatry, where bureaucrats often wear multiple hats as providers and policymakers. These complex relationships have prompted an investigation by the authors into these under-examined and in-between spaces in behavioral health politics and policy to improve our understanding of the intergovernmental institutions responsible for service provision, and the mechanisms and trends influencing policy choices. Willison and Einstein measure the realities, outcomes, and implications of police officers as primary actors and influencers of homeless policy. Singer examines the shifting priorities of public health and substance use in a changing partisan landscape in the case of Indiana’s HIV epidemic and needle exchange program. Strach, Zuber and Pérez-Chiqués examine the influence of administrative burdens on messages sent and lessons learned for clients and service providers of substance-use-disorder treatment programs in New York State.

Division 32: Race, Ethnicity, and Politics",September 16,am,8:00,9:30,Ethnic Identity and Patterns of Conflict and Governance in the Middle East,"This panel examines the role of ethnic identities in shaping patterns of conflict, political control and loyalty, and governance in the Middle East. The cross-national statistical literature on ethnicity and conflict has established a robust correlation between ethnically exclusive rule and violent intrastate conflict. However, case-based studies often suggest that ethnicity is not related to conflict onset in such a direct way and uncover dynamic processes through which ethnic identity becomes salient during conflicts. In addition, such studies stress the importance of moving beyond the focus on the national level to a close examination of the local dynamics.
The papers on the panel seek to refine and contextualize the mechanisms behind that macro-level correlation. For one, they examine the processes pushing ethnic identity to come to the fore of citizen claims and state strategies of rule, or to remain peripheral to those claims. In addition, they highlight other factors, such as regime type, that mediate the relationship between ethnicity and patterns of exclusion. The papers elucidate patterns of ethnic exclusion and control across a range of spatial and temporal contexts within the Middle East—from Ottoman Turkey to the contemporary Gulf and Levant. They do so using a range of methodological tools; two of the papers employ new quantitative data to empirically test their claims and two are based upon original interview research conducted at field sites. All of the papers draw on the authors’ extensive experience conducting primary research on contentious challenge and civil war.
Gunes Murat Tezcur, Yusuf Magiya, and Bogdan Popescu use an original dataset of all the Ottoman and Turkish governors between 1876 and 2019 to examine how regime type and appointments of governors affect patterns of ethnic exclusion and access to power and how ethnic identity colors perceptions of political loyalty. Staci Strobl examines the disproportionate impact of state violence on minoritized communities in Bahrain compared to non-minoritized groups, using patterns of governance in Bahrain to reflect more broadly on state violence against minoritized people in ethnically-divided societies and the MENA region. Dilan Okcuoglu, drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Turkey’s Kurdish borderlands, argues that informal Turkish state practices of control, including the use of arbitrary violence, are crucial to the success of its formal mechanisms for controlling the population of this border region. Kevin Mazur and Salam Alsaadi bring the debate on ethnic exclusion and conflict onset—which has primarily occurred to date with respect to sub-Saharan Africa—to the Middle East by extending Roessler’s coup-civil war database to the region; they argue that liberalization and arbitrary state violence by family-based regimes, rather than group cognitions or exclusion of ethnic elites, push conflicts along ethnic lines.",Lars-Erik Cederman ETH Zurich,Killian Clarke Georgetown University,"Informal Politics and Ethnic Conflict in the Middle East: Beyond Exceptionalism - Kevin Mazur, Northwestern University; Salam Alsaadi, University of Toronto

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 7: Politics and History,,September 16,am,8:00,9:30,The State and Sovereignty in Critical Perspective,"The state cannot be understood without taking into account its material and discursive associations with the human body, weaponry, coinage, borders, alliances, and many other entities. This panel assembles a group of political scientists, who bring critical continental theory to bear on the empirical study of those associations, especially as they relate to sovereignty, war, capitalism, and property. We are particularly interested in exploring the nexus of new materialism and constructivism (as they have developed in political science) with Foucauldian genealogy and Deleuzian assemblage theory.
The panelists will explore the associative nature of the state in four papers. Gerald Berk and Nicolas Jabko bring assemblage theory to bear on the state, focusing in particular on new ways to study sovereignty and war making. Charlotte Epstein draws on her new book, Birth of the State, to explore the naturalization of private property by the reassociation the early modern state with the human body. Victoria Hattam makes use of Deleuzian assemblage theory and the new materialism to reconceptualize how goods and people pass through sovereign borders at the boundary between the United States and Mexico. And Sebastian Schmidt applies new materialist and relational sociology to study the implications of contemporary security alliances that increasingly involve interoperability between state militaries.
Finally, we call upon the most prominent political theorist of new materialism, Jane Bennett, to assess our contributions in light of current debates in political theory over genealogy, new materialism, and assemblage theory.",Nicolas Jabko Johns Hopkins University,Jane Bennett,"The State as a Heterogeneous Assemblage - Gerald Berk, University of Oregon; Nicolas Jabko, Johns Hopkins University

This panel places the politics of complex global governance in and across time. Research on complex global governance, including so-called regime complexes, is strongly focused on the recent past and often focuses on complex outcomes rather than structuring processes. It is as if institutional density, overlapping designs, and tensions between forms of governance – or “complexity” – is unique to the contemporary context and static over time. But policymakers have contended with complex arrangements since at least the beginning of modernity when competing structures of governance emerged to deal with heightened levels of international exchange. This panel moves the research frontier on complex global governance forward by reaching back in time to examine the emergence and development of dense forms of global governance since the 19th century. Papers unpack the structuring processes of complex global governance from the late 19th to early 21st century across the security, economic, judicial, humanitarian, ecological, and technological domains. They probe the roles played by exogenous factors (e.g., wars, economic and humanitarian crises) as well as processes endogenous to global arrangements in understand the pace, location, and degree of global complexity. They identify mechanisms (e.g., layering, conversion) and actors (e.g., politicians, technocrats, international bureaucrats, lawyers, social movements) that have contributed to complex and varied constellations of governing authority across time.",Frederic Merand Université de Montréal,Frederic Merand Université de Montréal,"The Complex Historical Humanization of Global Governance - Giovanni Mantilla, University of Cambridge

Full Paper Panel,NA,Theme Panel,,September 16,am,8:00,9:30,Racism and International Relations,"We propose a panel under the conference theme “Rethink, Restructure, and Reconnect: Towards A Post-Pandemic Political Science” on the topic of racism in international relations. Scholars have increasingly called attention to the neglect of race in international relations scholarship (Anievas, Manchanda, and Shilliam 2014; Bhambra et al. 2020; Zvobgo and Loken 2020). Critics argue that core international relations theories were developed from “white” perspectives rooted in structural power asymmetries and racist assumptions about concepts like anarchy and sovereignty (Rolim 2021; Sabaratnam 2020). Racist ideas played an important role in early 20th century international relations scholarship, illustrated by The Journal of Race Development, which was renamed to later become Foreign Affairs, a leading journal for policy-oriented international relations scholarship (Vitalis 2017). These legacies came to be neglected as explicitly racist theories fell to the wayside and the subfield increasingly sought to portray itself in objective, scientific terms.
It is time to take racism in international relations seriously in line with the conference theme of rethinking and restructuring political science. Our panel will feature three papers that reassess conventional, race-neutral narratives of international relations and seek to push forward a new research agenda on how race continues to shape important aspects of the world order and IR scholarship. As the conference theme notes, the discipline is in dire need of research on “pressing societal issues related to equity, inclusion, and social justice in democracies to a peaceful international order.” Our panel directly addresses this gap and moves the discipline forward.
The papers in our panel reflect remarkable theoretical and methodological pluralism which are nonetheless unified in emphasizing the importance of accounting for race and racism in international relations scholarship. The Andrews paper tackles white supremacy in the study of international relations and the persistent erasure of non-Western perspectives. Chu, Schwartz, and Blair examine the intersection of racist beliefs and the use of weapons of mass destruction using novel survey experiments. Lipscy and Zhou argue that institutionalized racism has been a neglected feature of the architecture of international institutions, and use statistical analyses and case studies to demonstrate persistent bias in favor of white-majority states. Our participants reflect diverse perspectives in line with the conference theme and the substantive topic of the panel. Among other things, six out of eight participants are BIPOC and originally from five different countries. Current academic institutions in three different countries are represented.",W. R.

The papers on this timely panel complement each other as they theorize about the mechanisms underpinning the rise of conspiracism in the post-communist world and analyze the effectiveness of its targeting, the conditions under which conspiracy theories are likely to survive and spread on social media, and their feedback effect. They also address the uses and effectiveness of conspiracy theories as tools of domestic and foreign policies by authoritarian leaders. In their paper, Maria Popova and Nikolay Marinov propose a new theory of conspiracism that focuses on the erosion of political truth through a conspiracism spiral in political communication. Katherine Frances Cayton and Courtney Blackington examine conspiracy theory survival and spread on social media and find that those theories that can be memorialized and institutionalized are more likely to survive. They also reveal particular attractiveness of conspiracies that link domestic political parties to foreign actors. Roman Hlatky’s paper analyzes conspiracy theories from the perspective of their use as Russian foreign policy tool as he zeroes in on the effectiveness of disinformation campaigns. He finds that disinformation exacerbates existing attitudes and largely fails to convince those not predisposed to its messages. Finally, Rice, Manaev and Fitzgerlad examine the domestic uses of perhaps the most impactful exemplar of conspiracy theories at work—the U.S. Capitol riot—by authoritarian rulers. The authors demonstrate that the U.S. Capitol riot narratives reinforce anti-Western and anti-American attitudes among domestic audiences.

The panel demands that we rethink, restructure, and reconnect important elements of study going forward. Subjects include American exceptionalism, Chinese foreign policy under Xi Jinping, the definitions and effects of military intervention, and the role of racism in the study of international relations. Hilde Eliassen Restad asks if American exceptionalism can be salvaged for future use as an analytical concept and a research agenda. Or, is its meaning so broad and so malleable as to render its analytical purchase meaningless? Restad argues that re-thinking this often used and highly abused concept can be rehabilitated by separating its subjective and objective definition (narrative vs. measurable claim), as well as clarifying its range of possible implications for U.S. foreign policy in various historical eras. Restad attempts to separate a constructive versus a degenerative research agenda on 1) American exceptionalism as a concept and 2) its connection to U.S. foreign policy. Restad does this by offering a series of advice grounded in my own experience as a non-American who researches, and reviews articles on, American exceptionalism. Shale Horowitz and Kathryn Shapiro take different approaches to the study of today’s great powers. Horowitz starts with the fundamental changes that Xi Jinping has made to China’s foreign policy, which he says have potentially revolutionary implications for international security. Drawing on ideological statements and other evidence, the author identifies Xi’s foreign policy preferences and concludes that a broader approach to predicting preferences has greater explanatory power than those derived from general theories of international relations. Shapiro expands our understanding of U.S. military occupation by framing withdrawal and the occupation’s legacies as part of the conflict rather than the end of the conflict. Cases include the U.S. occupation of Haiti, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Afghanistan. Reframing identifies what was left behind that continues to impact the target of occupation. This research provides a welcome expansion of the understanding of military intervention and occupation to focus on the subjects of the intervention. Naunihal Singh grapples with the question of how much it matters if the concepts and approaches used by practitioners of international relations grow from racist and colonial roots, and if much of international relations is Eurocentric in focusing on a limited and biased sample of world events reflecting a flawed understanding of the cases it centers. The author structures the paper around four concepts: (a) the state / failed states (b) anarchy (c) ungoverned spaces (d) international order. It describes the critique of these concepts and suggests ways that the practice of international diplomacy and security might be changed as a result.",Tobias Hofmann Free University of Berlin,Christopher Marsh Joint Special Operations University,"American Exceptionalism: A Call for a Constructive Research Agenda - Hilde Eliassen Restad, Oslo New University College

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 11: Comparative Politics,,September 16,am,10:00,11:30,Rethinking Political Regimes: Comparisons of India and China,"Since the mid-twentieth century, Asia’s two giants have represented alternative models of political modernity. But the dramatic rise of Narendra Modi and Xi Jinping has witnessed a striking convergence in the aims, structure and exercise of power in India and China. Both leaders have promised to eliminate political corruption, reduce socioeconomic disparities, tackle ecological crises, modernize their economies and secure great power status. Yet they have also centralized power and promoted a leadership cult not seen for several decades, undermining the checks and balances that had previously developed. And both Modi and Xi envision a majoritarian nation, which has severely undermined the rights of minorities and contested peripheries, and stoked military conflict.
What are the causes of these strikes changes? What are the ramifications for their domestic politics and bilateral relations? And what impact have their respective political regimes had, or not had, on shaping these developments?
This panel addresses these questions. Sanjay Ruparelia examines how Modi and Xi and embraced high-modernist projects, concentrated political authority and expanded state power, and advanced singular nationalist tropes. Aseema Sinha analyzes the emergence of sweeping developmental campaigns in India under Modi, which display many longstanding features of the Chinese experience that continue under Xi, but retains key democratic techniques. Min Ye (Boston) examines the evolution of Sino-Indian ties in the realm of digital technology, trade and investment, and how border conflicts and the COVID19 pandemic encouraged the securitization of these relations.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 12: Comparative Politics of Developing Countries,,September 16,am,10:00,11:30,Gender Disparities in South Asia,"This panel sheds light on the factors that shape gender disparities in the political sphere with a focus on South Asia. There are several arenas in which these disparities come into play. First, in many South Asian contexts, there is a well-known gender gap in political participation both when it comes to voting as well as other forms of non-electoral political behavior. Second, there may also be a gender gap in the degree to which citizens see themselves as politically efficacious. Third, in the absence of gender quotas, women remain severely under-represented in elected bodies particularly at the national and state levels. And finally, the degree to which women in office have influence over decisions and policies also remains low in many contexts. The four papers on this panel shape our collective understanding of what factors drive – and mitigate – these disparities. In doing so, the papers highlight the importance of intersectionality – in particular the interaction of caste and gender identities - in shaping gender disparities. They also bring to light the importance of institutional features such as quotas and rules of discussions in local councils in addition to political and societal features such as party ideology, pre-existing gender norms, and intra-household gender dynamics.
The paper by Ali Cheema, Sarah Khan, Asad Liaqat, and Shandana Khan Mohmand focuses on gender disparities in political participation. The authors examine the effect of randomized emotional cues among 4000 men and women on willingness to participate in a set of political actions in the leadup to the 2018 national election in Pakistan. In doing so, the paper hones in on the gender gap in political participation and sheds light on the role that emotions play in widening and closing this gap.
The paper by Anjali Thomas, Sayan Banerjee, Charles Hankla, and Arindam Banerjee seeks to shed light on the factors shaping gender disparities in representation by examining how parties shape voters’ support – or lack thereof – for women candidates. Using a conjoint survey experiment conducted with a sample of 2,000 respondents in rural India as well as electoral data, the authors find that upper-caste women candidates receive lower support amongst voters when they are affiliated with the Hindu nationalist BJP, a party whose ideology prescribes patriarchal gender norms that target the party’s core Hindu upper-caste constituency. These results – which are driven by lower caste voters - thus shed light on how party ideologies that espouse ethnic gender norms can lead voters to discriminate against women candidates from elite ethnic groups.
The paper by Rachel Brulé, Simon Chauchard, and Alyssa Heinze uses data from an original survey in 600 Indian village councils to bring to light a gender gap in the influence of village council presidents using both reputational measures and behavioral observations and show that this gender disadvantage can be magnified or mitigated by inequalities on other identity dimensions. The authors then introduce experimental variation in the rules of the discussion in which the group deliberates about and decides upon budgetary priorities, and examine the effect of these discussion rules on the engagement of elected leaders in decision making processes and on the responsiveness of peers to the substantive input of elected leaders.
Finally, the paper by Tanushree Goyal uses a survey experiment embedded within the natural experiment of gender quotas in India to examine how exposure to female politicians shapes the political efficacy of women citizens. Goyal finds that exposure to female politicians results in lower levels of political efficacy suggesting that such exposure threatens women’s traditional identities. However, paradoxically, she finds that randomized information about gender quotas neutralizes this backlash effect. Overall, her findings show that gender quotas may lower backlash in contexts where norms about women’s traditional roles remain entrenched.",Rossella Calvi Rice University,Rossella Calvi Rice University,"Emotions, Permission, and Women’s Political Participation - Ali Cheema, Lahore University of Management Sciences; Sarah Khan, Yale University; Asad Liaqat, Harvard University; Shandana Khan Mohmand, Institute of Development Studies

Much of this research perceives IOs as static actors and focuses on their formation, institutional design, and visible moments of formal change. While this work has generated important insights, it overlooks the ebbs and flows IOs experience past their creation. Yet, these stages in the lives of IOs are critical for a more nuanced understanding of how IOs shape global cooperation through time. This panel gathers research focusing on the life stages of IOs, including birth, survival, and death. Following a common conceptual framework, contributions examine the economic, political, and administrative forces that steer IOs through various stages of life.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 2: Foundations of Political Theory,,September 16,am,10:00,11:30,Innovating with Machiavelli,"As this pandemic continues to roil politics around the world, the attendant flux and uncertainty are elevating the importance of political leadership, political ethics, and innovation in politics. Reimagining these concepts in light of current conditions can be done by taking a new view of theoretical works in which they are important, like those by thinkers as widely studied and taught as Machiavelli. For example, in a paper highlighting the normative necessity of institutional accountability in a democratic republic, John P. McCormick juxtaposes the role of the people in Machiavelli’s examples of what McCormick labels populist versus democratic leadership. Then, while acknowledging the disagreement Machiavelli’s interlocutor Guicciardini had with how much power Machiavelli thought the people should wield in a republic, Mark Jurdjevic’s paper proceeds to center the actual agreement of both thinkers about political ethics, including the false virtue of generosity, as relevant in a republic still today. Finally, Katherine M. Robiadek’s paper evaluates the move by posthumanists to decenter the human as a theoretical response to existential changes—from phenomena like the pandemic as it raises the spectre of human extinction as well as from scientific developments like gene editing as that alters the logic of human evolution—with the claim that Machiavelli’s conceptualization of innovation offers some purchase, indeed, on addressing those politically. Rethinking political science in light of the pandemic means rethinking the aforementioned political concepts in the history of political theory—and maybe even innovating along with Machiavelli.",Yves Winter McGill University,"Yves Winter McGill University

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 2: Foundations of Political Theory,,September 16,am,10:00,11:30,Uncivil Society and the Populist Crowd,"Several political scientists have examined the relationship between civil society, the “third sector” and democratic government. Scholars such as Robert Putnam, Sydney Verba, and Kay Lehman Shlozman argue that civil society benefits democracy by creating trust in government, increasing social cooperation, generating networks of engaged citizens, or fostering pro-democratic cultures. What about uncivil society? Especially the resurgent authoritarian-populist movements across the world have put the problem of uncivil society as a facilitator of violent crowds back on critical research agendas in political science. Yet, with a few important exceptions, political scientists have not explored uncivil society and its relationship to the populist crowd.
To address this gap, we have gathered four political theorists and political scientists from the United States and Europe who are currently researching uncivil society and its relationship to the rise of authoritarian populism, which tends to identify democracy with a particular uncivil crowd ‘taking back’ the country.

It includes three papers. The first paper, titled “Urban Chinese Support for Armed Unification with Taiwan in 2019” and based on a nine-city survey, examines which social groups are more likely to support armed unification with Taiwan and why, underscoring Chinese official media’s role in shaping radical Chinese nationalism. Whereas the first paper approaches Chinese nationalist sentiment from the societal perspective, the second paper, titled “China’s Network Propaganda on Twitter”, investigates the international propaganda activities of the Chinese state-affiliated actors on the social media platform. It demonstrates that the Chinese propaganda activities on Twitter are intended for the Chinese diaspora as well as the tech-savvy Chinese who managed to circumvent the Great Fire Wall, thus contributing to multiple fields of foreign propaganda, digital communication, and China politics. While the second paper examines Chinese external propaganda on the foreign social media platform as a whole, the third paper focused on how the rhetoric of Chinese diplomats stirs up nationalism in domestic social media platform. Titled “How ‘Wolf Warrior’ Diplomacy is Perceived within China?”, the third paper explores how the terminology of “Wolf Warrior” is perceived by the Chinese diplomats and the digital public, respectively. It underscores how the online nationalist sentiment is managed through the rhetoric of Chinese diplomats, and how the interplay between Chinese diplomats and Chinese online nationalists plays out in China’s nationalist foreign policy.",Keyu Chen Georgia State University,Lei Guang UC San Diego,"Urban Chinese Support for Armed Unification with Taiwan in 2019 - Dongtao Qi, National University of Singapore; Shengqiao Lin, University of Texas at Austin

Exploring Hard-to-Measure Interactions/Outcomes,"Given that numerous ‘invisible’ and ‘hard-to-measure’ interactions undergird the dissent-repression relationship, outcomes and mechanisms of interest are often difficult to observe and evaluate. These observational challenges often shape the way researchers construct and test theory given extant measures on one hand, while inspiring the innovation of measures on another. This panel brings together diverse projects that speak to dissent-repression and measurement, including an examination of the linkages between offline-online protest by tracking how political exiles spread information through social media networks to encourage protests back home, how electoral autocracies may utilize different variations of off/online repression to prevent protest, how machine learning and latent variable models can be used to classify human-rights violations, and how emotions can act as useful indicators for individual perceptions of repression when ‘no dissent’ is observed on the macro-level.","Courtenay R.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 37: Public Opinion,,September 16,am,10:00,11:30,Political Support and the (Electoral) Context,"Political support is a vastly studied topic in social science. Normative and empirical reasons explain scholars’ interest in this important topic. Among others, most citizens and theorists believe that liberal democratic regimes offer the best set of principles and mechanisms to keep elected officials accountable to citizens and responsive to their demands (Estlund 2007; Pettit 2012; Sen 1999; Waldron 1999). From the pioneering work of Easton (1965, 1975), two broad types of political support have been identified. On the one hand, diffuse support represents a long-standing predisposition that “refers to evaluations of what an object is or represents – the general meaning it has for a person – not what it does” (Easton, 1965, 273). On the other hand, specific support is based on citizens’ evaluations of a system’s performance at providing desirable outputs as a whole.
Our panel focuses on both diffuse and specific support, which are both important to understand. Deepening our knowledge of citizens’ assessments of their political institutions is crucial, even more so as they seem to have become more critical of these institutions (Dalton 2004; Inglehart 1999; Norris 2011). Moreover, many scholars believe that a minimum level of satisfaction with the performance of democratic institutions represents a key condition for ensuring the emergence, consolidation and stability of democratic regimes (Easton 1965; Lipset 1959).
While political support has received ample research attention, it has been argued that it is part of an evaluative process. Hence, politicians cannot just expect to keep on receiving stable support from the citizens, but citizens rather evaluate continually whether enduring support is warranted. This means that research on political support needs to be continually updated as well, to investigate the impact of new events, changing societal norms and expectations, and the changing zeitgeist more generally. Especially the COVID-19 crisis, with governmental decisions that have a large impact on people’s public and private lives, can be expected to impact levels and correlates of both specific and diffuse support. Therefore, for the papers included in the panel, we adopted a wide interpretation of possible broadened aspects of economic voting.
First, paper 1 focuses on the causal mechanism behind the winner-loser gap in satisfaction with democracy (SWD). Following a pre-registered design and using a unique dataset gathered in the hometowns of the Super Bowl teams, they test two possible explanations of observed differences between electoral winners and losers. This paper uses a novel methodology to investigate the core of the research on satisfaction with democracy as an important measure of political support.
The second paper leverages a natural experiment to identify the causal effects of political participation on democratic values. Broadening the investigation of participation beyond voting, it tests whether the political attitudes of Peruvian respondents change when they are randomly selected to serve as poll workers on Election Day. This paper fits the panel perfectly with its focus on explaining levels in political support – such as trust in democratic institutions and political efficacy.
Paper 3 uses a novel dataset that will be gathered in 2022 to investigate the relationship between people’s meanings of voting and their levels of political support. Focusing on a much understudied topic, the paper offers new insights in the meanings of voting from an individual perspective, and how this relates to partisanship, trust in government, and satisfaction with the government’s performance. This will hence result in new insights in the correlates of political support defined in both a broad and specific sense.
Finally, paper 4 focuses on the quality of democracy in a country to explain the association between educational level and satisfaction with democracy in that country. Using the largest cross-national electoral dataset available, it tests whether higher educated citizens are better able to bring their satisfaction in line with the actual state of democratic quality in the country: i.e., that they are more positive when things are good, and more negative when they are not. This study brings new insights in the important of the context when investigating measures of political support.
Altogether, the panel combines both theoretical and empirical contributions, including new research in understudied fields and novel methodologies. Our goal with the panel is to gain new insights in the sources and effects of political support broadly understood, and we hope to do so with a great set of scholars examining a diverse set of contexts (USA, Peru, Eastern Europe, and a comparative approach with 55 countries).",Ruth Dassonneville Universite de Montreal,"Jennifer Oser Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel

The most important shock introduced by the ICT revolution is the dramatic reduction in the cost of information and communication. Identifying the effect of ICT on organizing is crucial for understanding its impact on the distribution of power in organizations.

To date, however, we lack systematic understanding on how state-led trends actually affect the behavior of citizens, activists, and elected officials. How does democratic backsliding affect the behavior of opposition supporters? To what extent does repression alter activist and politician strategies? When can would-be autocrats influence the ability of the opposition to participate in democratic politics?
This panel addresses such questions using new text-as-data sources from understudied country cases, providing insights into how democratic backsliding manifests in popular and elite discourse around the globe. Davis and Morse employ Facebook data collected over a period of democratic backsliding in Côte d’Ivoire to theorize about the impact of disregard for term limits on opposition and incumbent strategies on social media. Jakli analyzes social media advertising campaigns purchased by the incumbent party to assess how early-stage autocratizers can induce political apathy among the opposition. Shen-Bayh and Choi examine oppression of opposition within parliament, comparing rhetoric in debates during a period of democratic turmoil in Zambia. Finally, through analysis of millions of tweets of Venezuelan activists, Siegel and Esberg show that exile fundamentally alters how opposition expresses dissent online.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 5: Political Psychology,,September 16,am,10:00,11:30,Mental Health and Politics,"Concerns over mental health have grown has a result of the pandemic. Not only have people spent most of the last two years trying to manage social upheaval, economic and mental stress, grief, and isolation, but preliminary research on the effects of the COVID-19 virus on the brain suggest longterm neurological problems, in addition to heightened depression and anxiety in people who have recovered from COVID-19 compared to people who have not been infected with the virus. Mental health affects numerous social and cognitive outcomes, including politics. Much of the existing research on individual-level mental health and politics focuses on the (de)mobilizing effects of mental health. For example, depression and sadness are demobilizing (Landwehr & Ojeda 2021), as is grief (Hobbs, Christakis, & Fowler 2014). Less work has been done in political science to understand the effects of mental health on other aspects of political engagement and/or political attitudes.
This collection of papers with data from three countries expands on the relationship between mental health and political outcomes, with an eye towards future directions in the discipline, to understand how well-being impacts political attitudes and engagement. These papers address issues of mental health related to political attitudes, election engagement, and adherence to pandemic-related policies (Baker & Loewen) and political attitudes as they form in early adulthood (Donnelly et al.). These papers also examine the role of mental health in intolerance of uncertainty and its effects on political trust (Tower et al.) and as a non-visible barrier to engagement with politics, working through cognitive concepts such as efficacy (Ozer et al.).

The panel uses Sadiq and Tsourapas’ paper on “The Postcolonial Migration State” as a starting point to further examine migration regimes outside of North America and Europe and to rethink how political science has traditionally understood migration and citizenship. In doing so, the panel’s papers examine themes of citizenship, noncitizenship, refugee populations, colonial laws, and borders across Egypt, India, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Zanzibar.
Lori foregrounds the domestic as well as international politics that underlie racial hierarchies in the Gulf region to show how that influences the status of refugees from Zanzibar. Frost illustrates that postcolonial states can respond to protracted refugee groups by using colonial tactics to “divide-and-rule” their populations, resulting in more exclusionary conceptions of citizenship, even in areas not linked explicitly to migrants, such as women’s and investors’ access to nationality. Dey conducts a historical exploration of how colonial states racially operationalized colonial borders in order to control migration within and across empire.
Together, the case studies and diverse methodologies employed in the papers highlight how identity politics and identity construction redefine membership and belonging in postcolonial societies. The authors illustrate the urgent need to re-evaluate contemporary debates on group membership, citizenship, and migration using critical, historical, and intersectional lenses. The papers also highlight the theoretical value of restructuring citizenship and migration studies to take postcolonial contexts and comparisons across them more seriously.","Fiona B.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 6: Political Economy,,September 16,am,10:00,11:30,Experiments in Fiscal Capacity,"Fiscal capacity is essential for economic development. Without sufficient revenues, governments cannot provide public goods, invest in growth, and uphold the rule of law. Yet, despite its importance, we have limited understanding of how weak states can build fiscal capacity. This panel brings together four papers based on field experiments conducted in weak African states that aim improve our understanding of the development of fiscal capacity.
Two papers in the panel consider fiscal capacity with respect to taxpayer compliance. Martin, Seim, Hoellerbauer, and Camacho use a factorial design to study interventions aimed at increasing tax compliance at Malawian markets. A first intervention aims at increasing compliance through enforcement related “top-down” approaches; as second bundled intervention targets quasi-voluntary compliance.
Continuing the theme of quasi voluntary compliance, Grieco, Abou Bakarr, Meriggi, Michel and Prichard report results from a field experiment aimed at increasing tax compliance by expanding taxpayer voice in the selection of neighborhood level government services. Collaborating with the Freetown City Council (Sierra Leone), the authors study an intervention that enrolls property owners in digital participatory budgeting town halls.
Whereas the first two papers consider taxpayer compliance, the second two papers take up aspects of tax administration. In weak states, legibility deficits and administrative corruption may further limit fiscal capacity. When the state cannot “see” persons and business with tax liabilities, why should they declare their tax liabilities to the state? Further, if they do declare, why should they not engage in collusion with the tax collector? Henn, Paler, Prichard, Samii, and de la Sierra model this decision formally and then use data from a field experiment in Kinshasa, DRC to test the model’s predictions.
Where governments’ administrative functionalities are limited, one strategy available to state officials is to delegate administrative responsibility to local informal elites with administrative experience and legitimacy in the eyes of local populations. Bergeron, Ngindu, Tourek, and Weigel investigate how taking on the role of tax collector for local government affects the legitimacy and accountability of city chiefs in eastern DRC.",Wilson Prichard University of Toronto,"Adrienne LeBas American University

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 8: Political Methodology,,September 16,am,10:00,11:30,Methodological Advances for Conjoint Experiments,"Conjoint experiments are increasingly used in political science as a means of assessing the impacts of various individual or profile attributes on attitudes and voting behavior. These experiments are especially important as they allow for the manipulation of what are traditionally un-manipulable features such as race or gender, broadening the range of questions we can obtain concrete causal answers for. Unique design features make these experiments particularly useful in these contexts: providing respondents information on multiple features can reduce social desirability bias and forced-choice designs often mimic real-life settings (Hainmueller, Hopkins, & Yamamoto, 2014). Despite the great benefits these experiments provide, challenges in design, analysis, and interpretation remain. This panel will dive into conjoint experiments as used in political science. Exciting current methodological developments and remaining issues with these experiments will be discussed.
The papers included in this panel will cover the spectrum from choosing appropriate estimands and optimizing the design, to modern analysis and inference methods. The first paper [Magazinik, Abramson, Kocak, and Strezhnev] introduces a novel estimand for conjoint experiments, which focuses on answering a question we often ask in political science: how likely is a profile with a given feature to be preferred to one with a different feature? The second paper [Bansak and Jenke] takes a common problem in conjoint studies, what to do about unrealistic profile feature combinations, and asks a new question: How do these odd profiles impact participant attention and behavior, and how can we harness that to design better experiments? The third paper [Ham, Janson, and Imai] explores a new conditional randomization test that a) focuses on the quantity of interest in most political science contexts, whether a particular feature has an impact on the response given information provided on other features, and b) simultaneously provides inference without model-based assumptions, while also allowing researchers to take advantage of modern machine learning methods to perform inference. The fourth paper [Goplerud, Imai, and Pashley] proposes a method that allows researchers in high-dimensional conjoint settings to explore and estimate heterogeneous treatment effects, which will realistically exist in any study involving a diverse population of respondents.",Nicole Pashley Rutgers University,Teppei Yamamoto Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Detecting Preference Cycles in Forced-Choice Conjoint Experiments - Scott Abramson, University of Rochester; Korhan Kocak, New York University Abu Dhabi; Asya Magazinnik, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Anton Strezhnev, University of Chicago

Full Paper Panel,NA,Related Groups / Society for Greek Political Thought,,September 16,am,10:00,11:30,Rethinking Freedom with the Greek Historians,"Freedom is arguably the highest ideal of modern political life. Liberals, Marxists, democrats, socialists, communitarians, conservatives, even alt-right reactionaries all praise freedom to the skies and defend their conception of freedom over and against alternatives. The same could be said of modern political thinkers from Locke to Hegel, Tocqueville to Arendt: freedom is their lodestar; all are theorists of freedom. By contrast, the preeminent thinkers of classical antiquity, including Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, and Augustine, reflected on and championed virtue as a higher good than freedom. True, freedom was integral to the life of both the classical polis and the Roman republic; but, as many scholars have observed, while these ancient polities produced philosopher-critics, they did not produce a democratic or republican theory of their own political practices, ideas, or institutions.
Yet this judgment may neglect the works of the Greek historians—in particular, those of Herodotus and Thucydides. In their histories, one finds searching examinations and dramatizations of freedom. On the one hand, Thucydides and Herodotus investigate freedom as a central idea in the political thinking of democratic Athens, drawing important conceptual distinctions between freedom and free speech, for example, even as they situate these concepts within the broader cultural and institutional framework of the city. In so doing, the historians provide us with an ancient, “illiberal” tradition of thinking about freedom worthy of consideration in modernity. Moreover, the historians can help us to reflect on freedom not in the abstract but against the background of the fractious, calamitous, brutal, and disjointed political history of ancient Greece, which is no doubt different from, but still evocative of, our own turbulent moment.
On the other hand, the historians also complicate Athenian perspectives on freedom, if not all democratic perspectives on freedom. Our papers examine these complications. Analyzing both Herodotus and Thucydides, Campa shows that non-democratic ancient regimes, such as ancient Persia and Sparta, had their own notions of freedom. The Athenian-democratic understanding of freedom was in dialogue with, even as it claimed to surpass, those of Persia and Sparta. Mahon-Rathnam scrutinizes the Constitutional Debate in Herodotus, unpacking the ambiguities of free speech within both the Athenian democracy and Herodotus’ narrative. Schillinger then tracks Herodotus' shifting representations of freedom, fate, bad luck, and divine jealousy. He finds a pedagogical movement in the Histories from deference to fate toward celebration of freedom. Focusing on Thucydides, Foster suggests that freedom often functions as a kind of noble lie—a shining ideal that persuades citizens to sacrifice themselves for the city, if not for an individual leader.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Theme Panel,,September 16,am,10:00,11:30,Considering the Place of Disability in Political Science in the Wake of COVID-19,"Writing in 1985, Harlan Hahn observed that political scientists had “failed to devote significant attention to disability,” this despite its prevalence and significance to questions of domestic policy (Hahn 1985, 87). Remarking on the potential transformative impact of disability studies on the discipline, Hahn invited his colleagues to explore the intersection of these two fields in greater depth. And yet, over 37 years later, disability remains a largely neglected topic of disciplinary inquiry. Over two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of disability both as an object of study and a lens through which to address questions of representation, equity and inclusion, public health access, and state obligation (among others) is evident. Indeed, the prevalence of long-term sequelae among COVID-19 survivors suggests significant social and economic implications, the scale of which we are only beginning to comprehend.
Taking up these issues, this panel “center[s] disability within politics” (to borrow a phrase from Jennifer Erkulwater). Together, the papers consider the role of political science scholarship on disability, making the case for its importance as we emerge from (and, indeed, continue to endure) the pandemic. Where Evans and Reher evaluate and build upon existing theories of political representation (which have mostly overlooked disability), Erkulwater looks to disability studies and identity politics to consider how “disability structures…contests over political identity and distributive categories in public policy.” Taking up the question of genetic engineering, Knight considers debates over the future and their significance for the political present. Finally, Heffernan turns to disability activism that arose in the wake of efforts to repeal Obamacare, tracing a shift in the kinds of rhetoric used by organizers in their efforts to secure disability rights.",Monica C.

Teaching and learning is central to the life of political science, being a key vehicle through which people engage with the discipline, we define ourselves as an intellectual field, and we sustain our place within the modern university system. It is also an arena in which we face many of the key challenges of the present moment including: the impact of the COVID pandemic; challenges relating to our mission and purpose from both governments and civil society; calls from inside and outside the academy to confront legacies of power and privilege; and events and trends in the political world including BREXIT and the rise of populist authoritarianism. This panel brings together scholars from diverse backgrounds and institutions to explore how political science can address these issues. It includes papers that situate how we can address these challenges within the wider trajectory of the development of the discipline in the UK, and work that explores and analyses emerging practice aimed at addressing issues including decolonisation, employability, and quantitative skills.",Donna Smith The Open University,John Craig Kingston University,"Storytelling: A Transgressive Pedagogy to Enable Decolonisation. - Sumeya Loonat, DE MONTFORT UNIVERSITY; Alison Statham, De Montfort University

Poster Session,In Event: Poster Session: Normative Theory & Federalism and Intergovernmental Relations,Division 28: Federalism and Intergovernmental Relations,,September 16,am,11:00,11:30,Poster Session: The U.S. National Guard in the Post-9/11 World,"Why is it important to study the National Guards at this moment?
The controversial role of the National Guard in attempting to suppress the June, 2020 Black Lives Matter protests in Washington, DC, the events of January 6th, 2021 in Washington, DC raises into prominence questions about the relationship between civilian political leaders and the National Guard. The debates about authority to engage the National Guard during the insurrection attempt of January 6th 2021 highlight its central place in the American system of National Security as a legacy of the fear of the possible deviation of the US federal government toward authoritarianism. Currently, the confrontation between the President and Governors of six states regarding vaccine mandates for the military, demonstrate a constitutional tension between federal and state-level civilian leaders with regards to who controls the National Guards, how, and under what conditions.
Similar debates occurred on the chain of command during the Katrina et al. events of 2005, demonstrating its importance in issues shaped by climate change, specifically in exposed states like Florida, Texas, and California whose political lives and predominant parties differ greatly. Furthermore, the tensions between domestic security institutions and some components of the US population also raises the question of how the National Guard, grounded in the concept of instantiating the “citizen-soldier” and therefore of American democracy, can be a sincere reflection of the whole population? Or, does it represent specific demographic groups and the ‘veterans’ Welfare State’ (Olivier Burtin, 2022) with its own divisions along racial, gender and ethnic lines.
Whither the National Guards: Constitutional Symbolism or Tightrope
We consider the National Guard possesses a special relation with the American federal system of government with its dual allegiance to governors and the POTUS, while active in natural disasters, domestic security, military deployments. Samuel Huntington in The Soldier and the State (1957) noted the constitutional tightrope the National Guard traversed. He explains, the division of the military into a national-level force and state-level militias was consciously undertaken by the framers of the constitution and, necessarily, involve the National Guards in federal-state politics (Huntington, 1957: 169). In doing so, he argued, the National Guard came to represent “two venerated constitutional symbols: the citizen-soldier and states’ rights” (Huntington, 1957: 173).
In terms of the political-military structure of the National Guard, the aspect of the dual control articulated in the Dick Act of 1903 meant “the national government should supply the funds and the know-how while the states supply the command and direction” (Huntington, 1957: 172). However, within the federal level itself, Huntington noted, “the fate of the militia is in the hands of Congress,” which could destroy the dual nature of the National Guard by relegating it to a state-wide militia by delinking it from the military or absorbing it into the military by federalizing it (Huntington, 1957: 174). Thus, indicating two possible arenas of civilian political competition over the National Guard: one between states and the federal government, the other between Congress and the President.
How The Panel Contributes to Understanding the Conundrum:
The four papers of the panel approach the topic of civil-miliary relations with regards to the National Guard with perspectives from political science and public administration. By doing so, the panel aims to answer Risa Brooks’ 2019 invitation to expand our understanding of civil-military relations by broadening its scope. The papers presented in this panel encompass constitutional law, Americanist and Comparative political science. It can also interest scholars of sociology including military sociology, management of the defense sector, International Relations, and political theory. The topics also cover law enforcement issues, debates about domestic terrorism, counternarcotics, immigration, and natural disasters.
The panel encourages presenters and discussants to open their reflection to the broader topic of paramilitary organizations and their place among coercive institutions (Greitens, 2016), such as conceived by Janowitz (1977). Furthermore, our understanding of the National Guard also gains from diverse methodologies—both quantitative and qualitative—as well as different paradigmatic approaches. Finally, the panel has male and female participants at all levels of scholarly careers from post-doctoral researchers to senior scholars.",Stephen M.

First, Noah Stengl studies the life of Black Hawk, the nineteenth-century Sauk leader, for a view of land that is based in gratitude, existential identification with land, and rejection of private property, all of which can help move beyond the prevailing Lockean conception of land as instrumental, strictly private, and extricable from questions of identity. Next, Chelsea Welker asks whether there are systems of valuation through which capitalism cannot successfully operate. Using Deleuze and Guattari’s concepts of the rhizome and “body-without-organs,” Welker examines capitalist projects of devaluation, including environmental extractivism, to develop a typology of political movements and strategies that might help overcome capitalist devaluation. Finally, Stephen Siu-Kay On reappraises the Western tradition of political thought through a Daoist lens and argues that, by and large, both ancient and modern political philosophers arrived at the Daoist conclusion that human mastery of nature is impossible—it is only us contemporaries who have not.",Gregory Koutnik Beloit College,Gregory Koutnik Beloit College,"My Reason Teaches Me That Land Cannot Be Sold: Blackhawk’s Conception of Land - Noah Stengl, University of Wisconsin-Madison

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 1: Political Thought and Philosophy,,September 16,pm,2:00,3:30,Socialism and Republicanism,"Over the past two decades, republicanism has provided one of the important interpretive frameworks for the history of modern political thought. But it is only recently that scholars have begun to explore its connections – both historical and conceptual – with the broad tradition of post-19th century political thought known as socialism. And yet, both traditions have long shared numerous historical and theoretical points of contact throughout their histories: ideas of self-governance, of duties and obligations to the collective (Viroli 1998), and ideas of freedom that make deeper demands on our relations to others than prominent liberal conceptions (Skinner 1998). As the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically exposed forms of domination and neglected dimensions of our civic interdependence, it has led to the need for novel ways of conceptualizing the role of government in political life. Investigating the connections between socialism and republicanism can provide vital resources for rethinking how we can manage our collective lives towards a horizon of freedom. Indeed, recent work by Alex Gourevitch (2014), William Clare Roberts (2018), and others has traced the influence of classical republican ideas on 19th-century socialist arguments about economic equality, revolution, structural domination, collectivism, and self-ownership, across both Europe and the United States. Additionally, historians and political theorists working on the socialist tradition, such as Gareth Stedman Jones (2016) and James Muldoon (2020), have begun to analyze the place of republican concepts like non-domination and popular rule within socialist politics.
In the wake of a global pandemic that has overthrown longstanding paradigms for thinking about the relationship between political participation and political economy, this panel will build on these exciting new developments in the history of political thought to more fully examine the intellectual links between republicanism and socialism. How might recovering socialist variants of republican thought transform our understandings of core republican concepts such as non-domination, civic virtue, and political equality? What can it tell us about republicanism’s evolving relationship to markets and political economy? Conversely, how might paying closer attention to republican ideas expand current narratives about the global rise of socialism from the 19th century? In exploring these questions, the panel will particularly focus on the reinvention of republicanism by socialist thinkers and movements at the margins of the Western Marxist tradition. The goal of the panel is to draw on the history of 19th and 20th-century political thought in order to better understand republican responses to prior moments of economic crisis. Reevaluating theories of resource use, collective ownership, political rights, and socio-economic equality within the republican and socialist traditions can help us imagine and reimagine new paradigms of citizenship and public good and help us foster new economic futures in the wake of COVID-19.",William Clare Roberts McGill University,"Robyn Marasco CUNY, Hunter College

Among these expanding areas of scholarship is Latin American political thought and its relevant publics. This panel focuses on the political thinking that emerged from or within current-day Mexico. Rather than nationalize the works studied, this panel deploys the category of Mexican Political Thought to bring together otherwise distinct research on Indigenous, judicial, transnational, and non-deliberative politics. In doing so, this session seeks to organize conversation on the wide array of research centering on colonial and contemporary Mexico.
Two of the papers in this panel consider the political and discursive contexts in which emancipatory and democratic political practices can appear, and how they do so, at very different points in time. Chang and Williams show how Rousseau’s reception of the case of the Tlaxcala, an Indigenous nation located in current-day central Mexico, and its relation to the Aztec Empire, marks a critical reappraisal of republican possibilities beyond Europe. The political chances and meaning of such possibilities were certainly entangled with colonial politics, and thus this paper analyzes the power dynamics of conquest and anti-imperial resistance as they manifested within colonial Mexico. Blajer, for her part, turns to contemporary Mexico to explore the merits of non-deliberative modes of engagement in promoting non-domination. In particular, she focuses on modes political interaction based on the rejection of the seriousness of the claim of the other, and on turning the point of contention and anger into something playful.
Two other papers, in turn, explore different judicial settings to understand the different ways in which both transitional and criminal justice have been articulated and practiced in contemporary Mexico. Espíndola tracks the ethico-political transformations of amnesties in this country. He shows that, in the course of the previous century, amnesties in Mexico have broadened their beneficiaries, the crimes in their purview, and, most notably, their justificatory grounds, pointing both to different power dynamics within Mexican society, but also to a legal-cultural transformation whose implications are worth understanding. Alfaro’s paper intervenes in the debate about the role of empathy in adjudication and, based on fieldwork conducted with Mexican federal trial judges, argues that beyond the debate whether judicial empathy is either an aid or an obstacle for virtuous judging, it is important to distinguish between different kinds of empathy whose respective strengths and weakness must be carefully assessed.",Paulina Ochoa Espejo Haverford College,"Isaac Gabriel Salgado Trinity College

Whether people possess official papers can be used to include or exclude them from participating in politics (including voting) as well as social programs. Yet being known to the state through official registration can also open up channels of state surveillance and control, especially when the establishment of a legal identity includes biometric dimensions. The papers on the panel analyze this double-edged nature of identity provisioning (from the supply side on the part of the state) and attainment (from the demand side on the part of society). Two of the papers (Bowles, and Scacco et al.) assess how ordinary people view the trade-off between inclusion and state surveillance in the establishment of a legal identity with biometric markers. The two other papers (Harbers, and Hunter) investigate which population groups have been incorporated or excluded by legal identity documentation regimes in the past and present, with Harbers focusing on ethnic minorites and Hunter on women. Given that navigating modern bureaucracies to access political, social, and economic rights and services depends ever more on having up-to-date identity documents, all the papers on the panel address a vital and timely issue.","Wendy Hunter University of Texas, Austin","John Gerring University of Texas, Austin

We begin with a paper studying the immediate transition period in which the GDR’s command economy was transformed into a market economy. The first paper finds that large-scale privatizations led to a pronounced socialist backlash as early as 1994, setting East Germany on a fraught electoral trajectory. The second paper explores deeper causes for far-right voting behavior in the GDR. In particular, the paper finds that men who were educated in the GDR are significantly more likely to vote for far-right parties, while this effect does not hold for women. The third paper examines differences in political attitudes between Eastern and Western Germans and finds that the density of social networks partially accounts for variation in levels of political disenchantment across both regions. Taken together, the papers on the panel examine how the fall of the Berlin Wall has caused radical voting behavior and thus offer a novel piece of evidence for Central and Eastern European democratic backsliding.",Jonathan Homola Rice University,Jonathan Homola Rice University,"Privatizations Spark Socialist Backlash: Evidence from East Germany - Anselm Hager, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin; Werner Krause, WZB Berlin Social Science Center

Our papers address disasters in the past, present, and future by asking: What does it mean to live through a global catastrophe? How does ongoing disaster affect political life? How should we think about the unevenness of suffering across different communities.? What does it mean to take political account of disaster in its aftermath? How does preparing for uncertain futures affect political life?

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 36: Elections and Voting Behavior,,September 16,pm,2:00,3:30,Political Behavior in Young Democracies: The Case of Contemporary Brazil,"Brazil is Latin America’s largest democracy. Around 150 million voters participate in elections in the country every election day. Despite economic and social development in the last decades, the young Brazilian democracy is still being characterized by personalism, political corruption, and clientelism. This panel brings together four papers by specialists on patterns of political engagement and voting behavior in Brazilian politics. All of them tackle contemporary discussions relying on solid theoretical background and modern techniques for political research and social inquiry.
The first paper examines how vote buying interacts with candidates' characteristics to shape voting intentions. The second studies how a candidate's promise to provide public services to a given constituency affects voting intentions depending on campaign strategies, the support of grassroots organizations, and candidates’ characteristics. The third analyzes how a programmatic policy (i.e., basic income) affects voters’ predisposition to participate in elections. The fourth examines how the effect of an exogenous economic shock on voting behavior varies depending on the extent to which voters rely on public services for insurance.
Overall, the research to be presented in this panel confirms that a combination of candidates' personal qualities, performance in office, and clientelism are key to understand political behavior in Brazil. However, it also reveals under what conditions each one of these four factors is relevant. Moreover, the panel underscores whether and how programmatic policies with direct effects on individuals’ well-being can undermine electoral clientelism while strengthening the quality of representation and electoral accountability.",Paula Rettl Bocconi University,"Nara Pavão UFPE

Full Paper Panel,NA,"Division 39: Science, Technology, and Environmental Politics",,September 16,pm,2:00,3:30,Research Frontiers in the Study of Climate Change Attitudes and Preferences,"How is public opinion about climate change formed? Understanding factors shaping the public’s attitudes towards climate change is not only crucial for academic research, but also has profound policy implications. For instance, addressing climate change requires that the public fundamentally change their behavior, which is unlikely to be achieved if most citizens are unaware of climate change and do not support climate change policies. A large literature has emerged over the past decade or so that examines climate change attitudes and policy preferences. This panel brings together four exciting papers that are on the research frontier of this research area. Together, they present new theories, measures, and discoveries that address some of the most important unanswered questions in the literature of climate change attitudes and policy preferences. For instance, how do natural disasters caused by climate change (e.g., wildfires and droughts) affect individual perception and policy preferences towards climate change? How do design features of climate adaptation policies affect their public support? Does public climate concern project onto a left-right ideological continuum in countries other than the United States? What are the potential drivers for this partisan polarization of climate change attitudes around the world?
More specifically, two papers focus on the connections between natural disasters and public attitudes towards climate change. In “Local weather extremes and political attitudes on climate policy – Evidence from Switzerland,” Quoß and Rudolph identify three key weaknesses in existing studies: 1) widely different operationalizations of extreme weather, 2) vast discrepancies in the range of the dependent variables, and 3) less credible public opinion and self-reported subjective weather data. Matching high-quality panel survey data of more than 3,000 respondents from Switzerland with fine-grained measures of temperature, rainfall and extreme events, they show that analyses relying on single specifications lead to arbitrary conclusions, while using the whole menu of independent and dependent variables often indicates robust null effects. In “Extreme Weather Events and Public Attention and Awareness of Climate Change in China,” Cao and Su switch the research focus from western democracies to developing countries. They find that in China, people living in places with more extreme weather events do not have a better knowledge of climate change and do not consider climate change more damaging; more surprisingly, local extreme weather events do not even increase public attention to climate change as reflected in climate change related Baidu (online) search volume index.
Moving beyond general public concerns and policy preferences, Andonova, Dolsak, and Prakash zoom in on specific climate policies and their design features. In “Public support for climate aid and climate immigrants: A conjoint experiment in Switzerland,” they study public support for two major climate change adaptation policies – foreign aid to and accepting immigrants from developing countries – that are designed to address the uneven distribution of climate change damages between developed and developing countries. Using a survey-embedded conjoint experiment conducted in Switzerland, they focus on six attributes of an adaptation policy: 1) the continent in which the country is located, 2) the types of extreme weather event this country faces, 3) the volume of climate aid, 4) the number of climate migrants, 5) Swiss trade, and 6) the country’s record of voting with Switzerland on human rights in the United Nations.
Finally, motivated by the observation that partisan polarization around climate policy has become consequential in the United States, Mildenberger and Bergquist present the first study of ideological structure of public views of climate change around the world. Based on a massive dataset of nearly 3 million survey responses from 164 countries and over 60 surveys, they find substantial variation in the degree to which climate concern projects onto a left-right ideological continuum. They discuss potential drivers of this cross-national variation. Their analysis in “Partisan polarization and climate change attitudes around the world” would help us better understand contentious politics surrounding climate change in most parts of the world.",Vally Koubi ETH Zurich,Gabriele S.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 44: Democracy and Autocracy,,September 16,pm,2:00,3:30,Resistance and Opposition Repertoires under Authoritarianism,"Distinct dynamics of resistance and opposition repertoires in Southeast and Northeast Asia have emerged to counter authoritarian convulsions amid global trends of democratic backsliding. This calls for renewed analytical attention and a closer re-examination of how forces of contention adapt under politically adverse landscapes and their respective outcomes, given differences in agents of resistance, their goals and strategies, as well as state structures and responses. What are the conditions that give rise to new modalities of resistance against authoritarian tides? When are political actors likely to mobilize and coordinate pushbacks against incumbent autocrats? Why do some oppositions succeed while others fail? How then do social movements in turn produce legacies that shape party organizations? And what determines the contours of state responses to social contention under authoritarianism?
The panel addresses these crucial questions through comparative analytics across different categories of societal actors (civil society, religious groups, and political parties), salient issue areas (democratization, elections, land, civil and political freedoms), and political regimes across the democracy-authoritarianism divide. The institutional and political complexity represented in Southeast and Northeast Asia as well as the region’s diversity with regard to other social and demographic indicators, especially in light of recent political developments and the elevated geopolitical importance of the region, also provide fertile grounds for the panel’s comparative studies. Methodologically, the panel leverages the rigor of both qualitative and quantitative analyses, while taking into account the contextual factors underpinning political processes in the region.
Using national survey data, Diego Fossati first dissects variation in individual evaluation of threats to civil and political freedom among Islamist Indonesians and their responses to the process of democratic erosion. Second, Elvin Ong and Syazwi Bin Rahmad then identify the conditions under which civil society organizations coalesce in Singapore’s and Malaysia’s electoral autocracies. Third, flipping the causal focus back onto societal contention, Erik Martinez Kuhonta and Illan Nam examine the contrasting impact of social movements on party formation in Thailand and the Philippines. Fourth, Nhu Truong analyzes and explains variation in the repressive and responsive elements of authoritarian responses to societal demands in Cambodia, China, and Vietnam. In conclusion, Ellen Lust, a specialist on the Middle East and North Africa, and Joseph Wong on Taiwan, South Korea, and East Asia, bring their prominent scholarship on institutions, governance, and democracy to bear on the overarching questions posed by the four papers.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 46: Qualitative Methods,,September 16,pm,2:00,3:30,Decolonizing Fieldwork,"Decolonizing Fieldwork fills an important gap in the methodology literature by highlighting fieldwork challenges and strategies employed by scholars conducting research in their native states and under repressive circumstances. Themes of discussion include weight of family history; religious, ethnic and gender identity; and legal and penal threats to native scholars. While Western colleagues often experience the burden of various identity markers such as family histories, ethnic identities, and religious affiliations, these markers often take on oversized importance in the cases of native scholars conducting fieldwork in their home countries. Native scholars may face more resistance when conducting research among wary compatriots who regard them with suspicion, or even hostility. Gender identity and sexual orientation can be a challenge for academics conducting research in any setting. However, native scholars working in illiberal settings cannot benefit from the relative tolerance extended to foreigners and must scrupulously adhere to local cultural norms and laws. Native scholars who have been detained and jailed in their home countries have received comparatively little attention from international media outlets or even academic circles. In addition to legal risks, native scholars, many of whom work in universities where job security is contingent on the ruling regime’s approval, also face significant professional risks.
This panel is based on an anthology entitled ""Decolonizing Fieldwork: A Practical Guide"". The anthology seeks to decolonize humanities and social science research by giving voice to personal experiences of native scholars in the field, the material and psychological hurdles that they faced while conducting research in a non-democratic environment.

Specifically, the study of immigration and forced displacement poses particular methodological challenges related to identifying credible research designs and data sources. Our panel, titled ""Methodological Advances in the Politics of Immigration and Refugees,” brings together researchers to advance and discuss cutting-edge methods for studying migration. Our panel includes four papers: Kirk Bansak (UCSD) and Elisabeth Paulson (Stanford) will present novel work on methods for effectively assigning refugees to locations during the refugee resettlement process. Moritz Marbach (TAMU) will present a detailed exploration of legacy studies, critiquing elements of research designs used in many recent empirical studies of immigration. Daniel Masterson (UCSB) will present a paper that formalizes and compares methods for combining multiple qualitative and quantitative data sources to estimate migration flows. Stephanie Zonszein (Penn) and Vicky Fouka (Stanford) will present a paper on how minority communities strategically respond to discrimination using community bank data to study Muslim borrowing practices after 9/11.

After a lull, it was revived in the aftermath of the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, at the hands of police, in 2020. This group of papers, to be published as part of a special issue of Perspectives on Politics dedicated to BLM, examines the movement from the perspective of the oppressed. The empaneled authors examine a variety of issues in this regard, including perceptions of law enforcement, motives for mobilizing, institutional bases for mobilization, and the like.

Visions of the hard boundaries of nations has led scholars to conceptualize international politics as a process unfolding exclusively among sovereign countries. Indeed changes in the structure of the global system has introduced far more players into the game. Non-state entities have arisen to compete with states in all important issue-areas. This new pluralist constellation has forced scholars to reconceptualize the nature of the global community and the consequences of these new sets of pluralist relations in terms of the new structure of power in international relations.,Albana Shehaj Harvard University,Albana Shehaj Harvard University,"Plurality, Pluralism and Heterarchy: The Restructuring of Power World Politics - Philip G.

First, Zhiyuan Zhang considers how housing privatization policy in China may have contributed to support for market-oriented policies, which became a source of political legitimacy for the CCP during the reform and post-reform era. Next, Zheng and Meng look at how top-down accountability may impact political trust at the local and central levels in China, with implications for political stability. Zhu Zhang then examines the role of business elites in sustaining authoritarian rule in China. The paper emphasizes the importance of the United Front Work Department (UFWD) in co-opting private economic elites, which contributes to regime resilience. Trinh then examines the phenomenon of statistical misreporting in Vietnam, explaining how this causes authoritarian leaders to downplay the importance of performance indicators for promotion decisions, which could have broad consequences for regime governance and stability. Finally, Jordanovska examines the use of surveillance software in Serbia’s hybrid regime, concluding that surveillance leads to self-censorship, preference falsification, and diminished trust in institutions among citizens, which could lead to further democratic erosion in hybrid regimes.",Martin Dimitrov Tulane University,"Martin Dimitrov Tulane University

Mary Shiraef’s paper traces the transmission of Greek identity in Hoxha-era Albania. The case serves as a lens to examine how officially recognized versus repressed minority group members transmitted their ethnopolitical identities. Adam Lenton’s paper focuses on the interactions between central and regional identity projects and asks why certain ethnic republics in Russia succeeded in crafting ambitious nation-building projects and strengthening ethnic identities, even under a centralizing Russian state under Vladimir Putin’s rule. Rober Moser and Mikhail Rybalko turn to the question of the factors influencing the representation of Muslim minorities by examining the descriptive representation of Muslim-origin MPs in the Russian State Duma. In their paper, they examine how regime type, electoral rules, demographic conditions, and party affiliation have affected the descriptive representation of Muslim minorities in Russia from 1993 to 2021. Finally, Tania Chilin, Raluca Toma and Marina Popescu use the case of Romania during COVID-19 to test whether—and how—a major crisis brings about a moment of heightened mobilization of anti-democratic attitudes and of social and political intolerance towards minorities.",Elizabeth Plantan Stetson University,"Matthew J Reichert Harvard University

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 12: Comparative Politics of Developing Countries,,September 16,pm,4:00,5:30,China's Non-Concessional Overseas Finance,"China’s engagement with the economies of lower and middle-income countries has increased exponentially over the past two decades. China’s efforts have included both bilateral partnerships and large-scale initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the Forum on China Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). However, it is commonly understood that China is not like traditional development partners. For example, its financing has come in the form of both concessional (aid) and non-concessional (commercial finance) packages. China’s outreach has been further complicated by the fact that the line between the state and private sector is often blurred, with many firms having either implicit or explicit state or party linkages. This session contributes to research in this area by focusing more explicitly on the political economy of Chinese overseas activities in low and middle-income countries. The four proposed papers examine political and economic causes and consequences of, and reactions to, this type of investment.
Kern and Reinsberg examine what happens if Chinese borrowers can no longer pay back their loans. While Chinese creditors often offer loan concessions, these are typically not enough to prevent default and borrowers therefore are left with no choice but to return to the IMF, facing higher-than-usual number of conditions in such case.
Brazys and Jung consider the extent to which Chinese official development assistance serves to ""pave the road"" for future Chinese foreign direct investment in localities across sub-Saharan Africa.

Why do states sometimes respond to these demands with repression and other times with policy concessions? This panel seeks to understand these core issues of contentious politics in Latin America. Together, the papers in the panel examine mobilization around critical regional conflicts: migrant flows, urban-rural divides, resource extraction, and police violence against a range of marginalized groups. Not only has the COVID-19 pandemic caused regional upheaval and exacerbated existing inequalities, it has brought into sharp focus the importance of studying domestic governments’ capacity to respond to global issues affecting marginalized communities. In the course of studying mobilization and repression, this panel highlights policy issues such as climate change, migration, resource endowments, as well as domestic interactions with multi/transnational institutions such as corporations.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 16: International Political Economy,,September 16,pm,4:00,5:30,The Mass Politics of the Backlash against Globalization,"The key pillars of globalization, open trade, economic interdependence, international cooperation, and multilateral institutions are currently under severe pressure. In many important economies around the world, nationalism, polarization and populist rhetoric and politics increasingly threaten the maintenance of an open international economy. In the context of globalization, the nation state is traditionally thought to play a crucial role in mitigating the economic costs of globalization and supporting the economically vulnerable. However, against the backdrop of the decline of the left, increasing polarization, economic pressures and international changing power relations, the salvaging role of the nation appears increasingly insignificant. This panel thus explores these different domestic and international explanations for the rise of anti-globalization attitudes and associated political behavior.
Balcazar and Park directly address the question of why the economically vulnerable vote for right-wing, rather than left-wing parties. Using game theory, they argue that the well-known cognitive bias of individuals toward overweighting losses - loss aversion - unpacks this puzzle. They show that individuals close to, but above the social-safety-net's reference point are more likely to be loss-averse. This occurs because the marginal benefit from government transfers these individuals obtain if they fall below the reference point in the future is smaller than the benefit they receive from paying lower taxes in the present. Therefore the relative benefit of redistributive taxation falls for the economically vulnerable due to loss aversion, boosting the appeal of right-wing parties. They also show that this cognitive bias increases the appeal of other policies that reduce international integration because the marginal benefit of limiting international competition in the present becomes comparatively large, providing also one explanation for the rise of attitudes against globalization. Finally, they show that politicians can manipulate individuals perceptions of future losses, to boost the attractiveness of the aforementioned policies via loss aversion.
Why are economically vulnerable individuals more likely to oppose free trade? Obermeier explores whether common frames employed in political rhetoric surrounding free trade agreements play a role in the relationship between economic vulnerability and opposition to free trade. Using an experiment embedded in a nationally representative survey of Canadians, this paper finds that the framing of free trade agreement shapes individuals’ attitudes toward free trade. In particular, while economically secure individuals express greater support for free trade when agreements are framed as liberalizing markets, framing free trade agreements as establishing common standards among countries boosts support for free trade among economically vulnerable individuals.
Political polarization and anti-globalization attitudes have both increased in recent times. Katitas and Orhan examine the impact of affective polarisation on globalization attitudes. In a large-scale survey experiment funded by NSF in Turkey, they seek answers to the following questions: Does antagonism toward out-partisans increase trade opposition when respondents receive cues that the out-party leader supports trade? Is priming national identity instead of partisan identity reduce the effect of partisan animus on trade opinion? Does partisan animus or elite polarization drive our results? Exploring these questions with a combination of vignette and conjoint experiments provide us new insights on how elite cues and partisan reasoning determine the backlash against globalization.
Polarization has also be accompanied by the increased vilification of trade with China, especially in the U.S. Nguyen, Sattler and Schweinberger therefore explore the importance of changing international power relations. With original survey experiments in the U.S. and China, they show that citizens from the declining power are increasingly concerned about unequal gains from international economic cooperation. Interestingly, these effects are not heterogeneous and prevail across different political ideologies and other social-demographic attributes. Whilst current U.S. politics is generally characterized by political polarization, a political consensus predominates for limiting trade cooperation with China.",Alexandra Guisinger Temple University,"Amy Pond Technical University of Munich

The panelists offer novel data sets, complex tools for inference, and original theories to help us better understand the politics of central banks.
Baerg and Binder use textual analysis to evaluate if modern central banks purposely use language directed at the general public and why there may be heterogeneity in the communication strategies of central banks. Weldzius re-evaluates the monetary convergence hypothesis, considering that regional interdependence via global value chain trade may lead to regional convergence in monetary policy; he utilizes textual analysis of central bank minutes and policy reports to show spillover effects of monetary policy between trading partners. Bodea and Hansen evaluate the role of central bank independence on shaping the preferences of central bankers; the authors introduce a new cross-sectional dataset on the appointment of central bank governors to test if CBI magnifies distinctions over monetary policy and if this can lead to harmful macroeconomic outcomes. And finally, Garriga and Gavin consider the relative decline in the stature of the IMF can motivate central banks to commit to financial stability; the authors use a formal model to illustrate the dynamics of this reform process and test their model using cross-sectional data from developing economies.",David H.

Seizing land and controlling bodies were twin techniques of European, white imperial governance in the modern era. Together, we consider the ideological roots of these practices as well as the different ways that colonized and colonizing subjects sought to contest, modify, or conserve them. From the colonization of the Americas to the post-Reconstruction effort to enable African American freedom to twentieth century struggles against carceral institutions, our papers reveal that politics must always negotiate the uses and apportionment of space in collective life. We ask, why does colonial politics invest in the regulation of space? How do bids to control space entail new forms of bodily control? What avenues for resistance exist within colonial formations of power? How can colonized subjects contest the control of space, territory, and the body without merely reversing the practices of colonialism? By investigating the role of place and space in articulating and sustaining colonial domination, this panel allows us to rethink anti-colonial and anti-racist political strategies.",Kevin M.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 21: Conflict Processes,,September 16,pm,4:00,5:30,Separatist Referenda Politics,"Referenda by nonstate actors are becoming more common and often serve as flashpoints for violent responses by the state (such as in Catalonia and Kurdistan) or nonviolent mobilization by civilians (such as in Scotland). Understanding the use and consequences of this form of democratic practice is central to our understanding of contentious politics. The four papers in this panel all explore the dynamics of referenda politics at the subnational level. Balcells, Cunningham and Goers explore the strategic use of referenda, arguing that these events are often the product of internal competition, where elements of a separatist movement use the vote to shore up power or in an attempt to maintain their stating as legitimate within the movement. Sanjaume-Calvert and Harguindéguy focus on when states tolerate such referenda, identifying several factors that lead states to support these risky events (including quality of democracy, level of competition with the state, internal dynamics in the movement, and temporal factors). Germann’s paper centers on the conflict resolution potential of such referenda, showing that any pacifying effects of such votes are conditioned on prior accord between states and separatists.

Full Paper Panel,NA,"Division 39: Science, Technology, and Environmental Politics",,September 16,pm,4:00,5:30,The Politics of Air Pollution,"Air pollution claims nearly 7 million lives per year globally – more than those resulting from AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria combined, and nearly 15 times as many deaths from war and other forms of violence. In addition, breathing dangerously polluted air has been positively linked to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, making one more likely to succumb to COVID-19 infection. Understanding the politics of air pollution has become timelier than ever, especially amid the ongoing pandemic. Yet, the politics of air pollution are understudied in the field of political science. The set of four papers in this panel explores the topic from distinctive but interrelated angles, speaking to literatures on political behavior, environmental politics and economics, local governance, and land use politics, among others. In doing so, they set an agenda for future research in this area.
First, how does air pollution shape political behavior? Little has been written on this topic, and the first two papers fill this critical gap by examining both developing and developed contexts. Based on evidence from 219 proposed coal projects in India, Hadden and Yarlagadda uncover an inverted u-shaped curvilinear relationship between air pollution and anti-coal protests, yielding important theoretical and policy implications. Henderson & Hunnicutt use an instrumental variable approach to demonstrate that particular matter pollution has a small demobilizing effect on movement participation in the United States – an effect disproportionately driven by the wealthiest, most educated, and most climate-concerned counties.
Second, given that excessive air pollution exists, what can be done to reduce it? What are the environmental impacts, and how do those impacts disproportionately affect the disadvantaged and marginalized? Buntaine, Komakech, & Shen explore how social competitions can mobilize local governance towards a socially desirable goal. They explore this question by examining neighborhood-level efforts to reduce trash burning, a major contributor to air pollution and public health crisis in Uganda. Findings from this study can be scaled up to help improve formal waste services, reduce waste burning, and subsequently, lower exposure to air pollution and susceptibility to COVID-19. Zirogiannis et al. study the environmental impacts and justice issues surrounding concrete batch plants (CBPs) – small, industrial facilities that mix cement, water, and aggregates (e.g., sand, gravel) to produce concrete – in Houston and Chicago. In both cities, the authors find that poorer tracts are located closer to CBPs, but the race-based disparities only exist in Houston. The results yield important implications for the study of environmental politics and local land use.","Jennifer Hadden University of Maryland, College Park",Patrick Bayer University of Strathclyde,"Does Air Pollution Drive Protest around New Coal?

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 47: Sexuality & Politics,,September 16,pm,4:00,5:30,Trans-Regional and Trans-National LGBTQ Activism in the Global South,"This panel examines trans-regional and trans-national LGBT activism within the Global South. The literature on LGBTQ international advocacy work is dominated by questions examining international advocacy emanating from the Global North. Central to this literature is Massad’s influential work in which he argues that international LGBT activism is a form of cultural imperialism. Massad’s work forms part of a growing literature debating the impact of international LGBT advocacy in the Global South and the globalization of the human rights discourse. This literature raises important concerns about the power imbalance between Global North and Global South actors and the potential harms this has on local Global South LGBTQ organizing. However, the literature’s overwhelming focus on transfers from North-to-South is to the neglect of South-to-South LGBTQ organizing and connections. While scholars have examined why Global South movements are more likely to make cross-regional connections to the Global North, the origins, significance, and impact of trans-regional and trans-national LGBTQ organizing and connections within the Global South remain largely unexplored. This panel addresses this lacuna. Focusing on Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America, the papers examine four different forms of South-South LGBTQ organizing and/or connections. Clark and Pazsat’s paper examines UHAI EASHRI, Africa’s first indigenous activist fund supporting sexual and gender minorities and sex worker human rights, and the pan-African, activist-planned and –led biannual conference it hosts, to understand how African activists are challenging North-South power imbalances and decolonizing activism. Kurse’s paper examines online queer activism in the Middle East. Examining Latin America, Balaguera looks at transgender women asylum seekers and the transnational informal networks of legal accompaniment that support them in the Mesoamerican migration circuit. Finally, Moreau examines the consequences of changing regional norms for LGBT movements, particularly the case of Paraguay and how the adoption of same-sex marriage by Argentina influenced the Paraguayan LGBT movement.","Janine Clark University of Toronto, Mississauga",Francesco Cavatorta Laval University,"Trans-Regional LGBTQ Organizations and Decolonization in Africa - Emma Paszat, York University; Janine Clark, University of Toronto, Mississauga

How and why do democracies engage with the political participation of their emigrants? What explains immigrant political participation? When do citizens support non-citizen electoral inclusion? These papers adopt a wide range of methodological tools to explore such questions and add to our understanding of the democratic inclusion of migrants from the perspective of immigrants, emigrants, and citizens. Using interviews and primary state documents, Pedroza reveals how a new path toward special representation of migrants opened in Mexican Congressional Elections. Finn relies on interviews of immigrants within Latin America to theorise how immigrants build political ties to their host countries. Wellman moves our focus to the African continent, presenting results from a survey of domestic and international migrants in three African cities. Here, Wellman explores how sending and receiving contexts create (or hinder) migrant participation. Finally, Zonszein and Capes-Davis consider how non-migrant citizens view immigrant electoral inclusion using a survey experiment in the United States.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 6: Political Economy,,September 16,pm,4:00,5:30,State-Making and Political Participation: Historical versus Modern Perspectives,"A well-functioning state appears vital to good governance, economic development, and democratic success. Here, the historical experience of state-making and political participation in Europe provides a standard reference point. Yet the extent to which lessons drawn from the European experience actually apply to the modern developing world is not always clear. Nor are the scope conditions under which such lessons might apply. Furthermore, while the literature tends to focus on the triumph of parliamentary governance in Europe, the reality is that non-democracy characterized much of its pre-modern history. To make progress on these fronts, this panel will put two papers on historical state-making and political participation in Europe in direct conversation with two papers on modern such themes in other parts of Eurasia – namely, China and MENA. Each paper makes use of formal modeling and/or fine-grained databases and quantitative methods of analysis. To round out this panel, two discussants will bring to bear their expert perspectives on state and political performance in Russia and Sub-Saharan Africa, respectively. By taking a rigorous approach that intentionally spans both past and present, this panel will improve our knowledge of state-making and political participation experiences across Eurasia, as well as the points of applicability – or lack thereof – of any lessons that might be drawn from the canonical experience of Europe.",,"Jessica Gottlieb University of Houston

Full Paper Panel,NA,Related Groups / Conference Group on Taiwan Studies,,September 16,pm,4:00,5:30,Political Perception and Information in Taiwan,"In the era with information across all issues, how various information sharps voter’s political perceptions become a critical topic in both academia and practice. These flows of information could result from voters’ ideology and cohort effects, campaign strategies, or cohort effects between groups. Revealing how information flows between voters, we could further understand contribute to several crucial discussions about democracy and governance, such as the rise of popularism as well as the democratic decoy. This panel proposes to address how information strategy affects public perception in different but critical issues in Taiwan.
The panel is expected to contribute to the literature firstly by addressing the function of political information largely on public perception, rather than solely electoral behavior, which is the classical variable that Taiwan studies largely emphasize. When people vote, their perceptions of the issues or the party are one of but not the only factor influencing their decision. In other words, public perceptions might be correlated with voting behavior but not always. Analysis directly on public perceptions can provide direct and stronger empirical evidence to understand Taiwan politics. Second, the panel includes papers discussing both conventional but crucial questions and the latest developed issues. The former includes how voters understand the party’s position on the unification-independence issue as well as legislators’ preference; the latter covers the latest discussions on the 2021 Referendum and issues related to direct democracy.",Da-Chi Liao National Sun Yat-sen University,"Greg Chih-Hsin Sheen National Cheng Kung University

Full Paper Panel,NA,Theme Panel,Division 48: Health Politics & Health Policy,September 16,pm,4:00,5:30,The Politics of Pandemic Response and the Opportunities for Health Policy Reform,"The COVID-19 pandemic provides an important opportunity to rethink and restructure the public health and health care sectors of both the Global North and Global South. In order to improve policy responses to future public health emergencies, as well as to repair and improve the health care systems that have been (further) fractured by the pandemic, it will be necessary to critical assess and learn from the factors that have shaped the often failed and fragmented response to COVID-19. In their paper, Rozenblum, Greer, and Jarman investigate why the well-established and well-funded public health agencies of France and the United States were sidelined in policy discussions at the exact time their expertise and input was most needed. In mapping out the role of public health professionals and institutions during COVID-19 in France and the United States, the authors find that the advice of public health professional was ignored by policymakers because public health professionals lacked adequate policy tools and occupied a contested professional domain. Kuo and Kelly investigate the comparative COVID-19 policy response across counties and regions with California. In moving beyond a consideration of formal state and public health capacity, Kuo and Kelly argue that the more robust policy response of the Bay Area was, in part, a product of partnerships between state and community-based actors. Drawing on the concept of “embedded autonomy,” Kuo and Kelly reconceptualize public health capacity and consider it within broader issues of state capacity and democracy. In their paper, Trujillo and Motta theorize how vaccine hesitancy and the politically contentious nature of vaccines during COVID-19 may “spillover” into the post-pandemic era and increase negative attitudes towards childhood vaccine mandates, elective adult vaccines, as well as vaccines still in development. In finding that such spillover effects are present, Trujillo and Motta also consider how strategic communication may encourage future vaccine uptake. Finally, Vitale examines the complex interaction of national social policy and international inteventions during COVID-19. In focusing on the Haitian-Dominican border, Vitale finds that diverted resources, unstable funding structures, hidden or misaligned donor priorities have kept some populations in intense precarity. The transnational and national pandemic response has produced ill health through fragmenting and financializing the health care sector.",Philip B. Rocco Marquette University,"Colleen M.

This panel examines the multifaceted dynamics of these phenomena. The papers analyze the impetus for civil society mobilization, the gendered repression of these movements, and the tools of resistance that civil society organizations deploy. The panel draws attention to the severity of the political challenges faced by the region’s women and showcases their resilience.

Toh uses elite interviews and text analysis to argue that states with more international influence have greater power to shape how their domestic political instabilities are addressed by regional organizations like ASEAN. Lin uses the case of Vietnam to highlight how leaders balance the security pressures brought on by the competing interests in the region of China on the one hand and the US, Japan, India, and Australia on the other. The second set of papers focuses on domestic political instabilities. Toha relies on analysis of over a decade of elite- and mass-based texts in Indonesia to illuminate the long, gradual process of how democratic backsliding occurs.

Friederike Alm explores the impact of the global pandemic on migration politics – i.e., whether countries opened or closed their borders and access to resources to new migrants – using a comparative-historical analysis (CHA) of three democracies, Canada, France, and Germany. Gallya Lahav and Anthony M. Messina explore how Covid-19 has led to a similar creation of conditions as September 11, 2001, where nation-states create “special legal regimes” that are exclusionary and targeting of Muslim and Asian populations. Turning from a focus on government’s migration policy to government’s use of framing, Jan Kovar explores the framing of immigration in the Czech and Slovak parliaments between 2013 and 2021 to shed light on how party actors frame immigration in Central Europe, with a focus on framing around the refugee crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. Taken together, the papers in this panel showcase how the pandemic has opened a new space for migration politics to vary across countries or for critical junctures to emerge within countries’ approaches to policy and framing.",Triadafilos Triadafilopoulos University of Toronto,Triadafilos Triadafilopoulos University of Toronto,"COVID as a New Critical Juncture: The Pandemic Impact on Migration Politics - Friederike Alm, Goethe University, Institute of Political Science

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 1: Political Thought and Philosophy,,September 16,pm,12:00,1:30,Sounding the Political,"Political theory, and the broader discipline, buzzes with debates that center deliberation, communicative reason, “fact-checking,” and persuasion, all of which dial in on the conditions for rational speech to be intelligible, binding, and even transformative in democratic life. Typical of the “linguistic turn,” such accounts too often reflect an uncritical optimism toward the powers of speech and rationality that tends to mute the role of hearing and generally cancel what does not conform as just so much noise. While some scholars have recently begun to ask after the political conditions of listening, the papers gathered in this panel seek critical distance from the confident consensus that we know well what politics sounds like when we hear it.
“Sounding the Political in Contemporary Theory” challenges this conceit at the register of the sonic to solicit curiosity toward the ambivalent auditory world of political sounds, murmurs, noises, rumors, roars, grumbles, and utterances that texture public political life. Together, they ask us to attenuate our impulse to only record what is familiar in the service of cultivating a more democratic ear for what is disconcerting, polyphonic, and pandemonious. At stake for each of these papers is willingness to depart from conventional methodologies - whether in political communication, classics, or sound studies - to theorize anew the way that the sounds and noises of our political world may ambiently squelch and summon democratic politics. In dialogue with resources in queer studies, feminist theory, and affect studies, these papers read across scenes of radical democratic protest, ancient tragedy, and cinema to dilate the audible bounds of the political. In this way, each paper sets out to “sound” the ways in which we hear political phenomena such as disobedience, uprisings, and world-altering destruction.
In “The Curtain and the Closet,” Bonnie Honig argues that Singin’ in the Rain (dir. Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly, 1952) and Sorry to Bother You (dir. Boots Riley, 2018), two films about new technologies of vocal commodification and the sonic (mis)adventures they cause, soundtrack then sidetrack their central heterosexual romances by way of a wayward Black sonic that can be queered. In “Polyphony and the Politics of the Chorus,” Danielle Hanley reads the Medea and Hecuba in conversation with Maria Lugones and Saidiya Hartman to confront the presumed intelligibility of difference that arises in the phonic pulses of these bodies to create a polyphonic collective capable of capturing the role noise and sound play in rendering ourselves and each other present in moments of devastating loss so as to ask, What alternative configurations are possible, what can we salvage, as the sounds of our grief and rage circulate? Finally, in “Noise Politics,” Samuel Galloway and Joseph Sannicandro follow Lauren Berlant to argue “noise politics is at the heart of the popular,” from the dog whistle to the clamour of protest, by mapping the political valences of those noises that produce “static” and those which amplify “commotion” to offer a democratic account of noise politics attuned to those instances of action in disconcertion (pace Arendt) that open spaces of audition wherein the very partition of signal/noise is called to attention.
Taken together, “Sounding the Political in Contemporary Theory” offers a productively dissonant account of democratic discourse. In “sounding” disciplinary consensus, these papers hope to open space to hear anew those who are muted, drowned-out, or cancelled. In this way, the papers presented here both invite and model the reflexive democratic work of attending to whom we listen, and how.",Siddhant Issar University of Louisville,James R.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 12: Comparative Politics of Developing Countries,,September 16,pm,12:00,1:30,The New Polarization in Latin America and Its Implications for Democracy,"Latin American democracies, like those in other parts of the world (McCoy and Somer 2019), have been buffeted by rising levels of political and ideological polarization over the past two decades. Although polarization is hardly unknown in the region—it was integral to the wave of democratic breakdowns in the 1960s and 1970s (O’Donnell 1973; Valenzuela 1976)— new forms of polarization lie in sharp contrast to the1990s, when the so-called “Washington Consensus” for economic and political liberalism dominated across the region. This new polarization has yet to receive systematic scholarly attention, even though the conventional wisdom suggests that political moderation and ideological depolarization were vital to the consolidation of Latin America’s “third wave” democracies in the late 20th century (Mainwaring and Pérez-Liñán 2013).
Why, then, after a generation of political moderation or even convergence, have Latin American polities become so deeply divided or polarized once again? And, given the historical track record, what are the implications of this new polarization for democratic representation and the vitality and stability of democratic institutions? This panel brings together scholars from both the U.S. and Latin America to address these questions from a range of different perspectives. The papers employ diverse methodological toolkits to examine different types of data at both elite and mass levels of analysis, as well as the interaction between polarization dynamics at these different levels. The papers include a mix of country or case-based analyses (Mexico, Colombia, and Chile) and cross-national, region-wide assessments of polarization dynamics. At the mass level, they examine trend lines in public opinion and mass political identification, as well as relationships between ideology, partisanship, cultural identities, and anti-establishment or anti-institutional sentiments. They will also analyze social mobilization and protest dynamics and their impact on mass attitudes toward political institutions. At the elite level, they use data from Facebook and Twitter messages to examine populist discourse, misinformation, and issue framing; the diffusion of both polarizing and de-polarizing messages; and elite activation of polarized attitudes in the public at large. Taken together, these papers will shed new light on the multiple dimensions of polarization processes, the factors that encourage and potentially inhibit polarization, and the impact of polarization on democratic representation and contestation.",Kenneth M.

In many issue areas, the creation, design, evolution, and effectiveness of individual governance institutions are fundamentally shaped by how these institutions relate to and interact with other institutions operating in their domain. A large swathe of recent work in international relations and international law acknowledges the importance of institutional complexity for understanding global governance. However, much existing work focuses on developing typologies to better grasp the phenomenon and, empirically, are often based on the study of single cases, or limited to particular issue-areas. In addition, existing works tend to focus on states and formal intergovernmental institutions as the major components of regime complexes, while non-state actors and informal institutional arrangements have received less attention. Thus, despite a proliferating literature on institutional complexity, major conceptual, theoretical, and empirical questions remain. The papers on this panel address this research gap. Using new data and innovative methods, they map institutional complexity in a broad range of issue areas of world politics and develop new theoretical arguments to explain the emergence, development, and consequences of institutional complexity. Together, they make important theoretical and empirical contributions to the study of global governance and open up avenues for future research.","Jon C. W.

Each paper in this panel leverages new and novel data to better understand the factors that influence security sector reform at varying levels of analysis. Mailhot and Kriner’s paper approach this topic by explaining how international assistance from different parties to the police forces around the world can influence the reform process differently. On the other hand, using original cross-national data on different forms of institutional reforms within the security forces, Izadi and French show that several domestic as well as international factors can influence different forms of reforms within both police and military institutions that target militarization as well as professionalization. Furthermore, Kriner, Izadi, Pruett, and Mailhot’s paper takes up the issue of security force members’ behavior from an individual level. Using novel survey data from police and military institutions in several countries, they show how peacekeeping experiences can have a pacifying effect on police and military personnel’s attitudes towards the use of violence. Matanock’s paper also investigates security sector reform from an individual level of analysis and using novel survey data from policy-makers in the United Kingdom, she explains how outside actors consider and support delegation agreements that involve security sector reform within the host state.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 23: Presidents and Executive Politics,,September 16,pm,12:00,1:30,Understanding Government Transparency,"An informed public is an essential component of government accountability. In the U.S., federal and state governments have institutionalized government transparency through the development and adoption of Freedom of Information (FOI) laws, which can aid in public and legislative awareness of executive branch activity. In addition to FOI laws, chief executives have developed a variety of institutional and organizational apparatuses to communicate government actions to the public. However, increased transparency has not come without resistance from executive branch actors given the potential negative impact and ""bad press"" from internal information released through formal and informal means. Political and institutional conditions can not only affect the contours and strength of transparency policies, but also encourage strategic behavior on the part of executive actors when determining how much information to share with the press and public. However, withholding information does not come without its own risks, as agencies can face expensive and timely legal challenges when restricting formal access to government information. The papers on this panel will explore executive branch transparency from a historical and contemporary lens, at the state and federal level, using a variety of research methods. What institutional structures have presidents put in place to control the flow of information to Congress and the press? In addition, when do presidents decide to publicize certain unilateral actions while concealing others? How does the implementation of government transparency policy and disclosure of information vary across state executive environments? And when government withholding of requested information is challenged in court, what factors affect whether courts defer to federal agency autonomy over transparency decisions?

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 53: African Politics,,September 16,pm,12:00,1:30,African Survey Research: Innovations and Applications,"African politics research has been at the forefront of cross-national survey research for decades. The Afrobarometer survey has provided a public good that allows us to track public opinion in Africa over time and across countries. However, later years have seen significant innovation in African survey research both through the Afrobarometer itself and other newer and more specialized survey projects. As of late, more research has used new approaches to better grasp causality, relationships between public opinion and geographic context, introduce more specialized questions on political behavior, and capture longitudinal changes in political attitudes. Moreover, research is leveraging rapid technical transformation on the continent to experiment with new modes of surveying African populations. This panel offers a mix of applied survey research and more conceptual and methodological contributions to illustrate the cutting edge of African survey research and its contribution to comparative political science more broadly.
Baldwin et al. use new survey data from Kenya to develop new conceptualizations and measurement of political participation in developing countries. While democratic participation has been at the heart of African political research, most existing measurements used in the context have been conceived in the developed world among consolidated democracies. Baldwin et al. propose a new conceptualization and measurement that better captures the complexity of African political participation.
Scott utilizes the new geo-coded Afrobarometer data to shine light on a central question in comparative politics: how does in-group violent conflict shape national identities? He particularly studies whether in-group violence inside ethnic enclaves destabilize in-group solidarity. The paper contributes to wider debates on how individual-level characteristics interact with geographical context to shape identities.
Kerr et al. use a new panel-survey from the 2021 Zambian election to study the impact of electoral turnover for perceptions of electoral legitimacy. Comparing perceptions of electoral integrity immediately before Zambia’s historic 2021 election with perceptions of the same after the turnover, they find a significant increase in positive perceptions among opposition supporters without a corresponding decline in perceptions of electoral legitimacy for government party supporters. This finding is remarkable given that the turnover happened despite a heavily manipulated election and emphasizes the importance of using panel data to explore short-term changes in public opinion.
Schultz-Herzenberg and Mattes study political mobilization during the 2019 South African election. They introduce a new argument about the relationship between vote choice and turnout. More particularly, they argue that in the context of low government performance and an opposition unable to offer a credible government alternative, government-party voters are more likely to abstain than vote for the opposition.

Political scientists have usually seen participation operating along two registers: the articulation of interests and their aggregation to build electoral majorities, assigned to two different types of organizations. While interest groups and movements articulate interests, it is parties that aggregate them. But as recent studies and political crises show, this division of labor does not neatly map into these two boxes. When movements turn to electoral politics, their strategies and personnel are largely shaped by their interactions with parties; and parties are increasingly forced to take account of – indeed, sometimes to act like – social movements when they are challenged by increasingly aggressive movements. This panel will examine a wide range of party/movement interactions – from the nineteenth century to the present. Participants will also consider how institutional developments – for example the development of the modern presidency, the hollowing out of Congress’s legislative and oversight capacities, and the growing influence of the Judiciary on high stakes domestic and foreign policy -- have affected the dynamic interaction between movements and parties.",Sidney M.

The Critique of Atheistic Humanism by Henri de Lubac. A Religious and Metaphysical Approach to Totalitarianisms
Eric Voegelin says he is indebted to the thought of Henri de Lubac, and among other things to his notion of atheistic humanism. Lubac, by seeking the metaphysical and religious meaning of the totalitarian movement, comes to show that European thought carries out a rejection of Christianity which leads to a metaphysically absolute alternative, experienced in personal and social consciousness as a drama. I will explore the genesis of this idea and the consequences for the future positioning of politics over religion, especially forms of agnosticism.

Radicalization and Immanentization: Questioning Eric Voegelin’s Conceptual Apparatus Suitability on Contemporary Radicalization
The question of an identical process of radicalization for religious and political beliefs brings back potential porosity between religion and politics. In his essay, “Gnostic Politics” (1952), Eric Voegelin draws a parallel between XVIIth century English Protestantism and XXth century Communist ideology through the longing of a violent fulfillment of a “dream reality”. This article strives to question the suitability and uses of Voegelin’s concepts in the study of contemporary radicalization and radical behaviors.""
- Pierre-Alain Drien: (Lyon 3 University)
Divinization of Thought. Can We Definitely Oppose Rawls to Voegelin?
Rawls and Voegelin are known to be political philosophers, but they represent two different understandings of political truth.
These ways are crystal clear when they deal, for instance, with social contract theory; according to Rawls, this doctrine, and its Rawlsian specificities, enables to reach justice and a viable political order, while, for Voegelin, especially in Hobbes' thought, it portrays a gnostic setback to build a theologia civilis, and then, it reveals itself unable to achieve any real justice or common good.
But, although Rawls seems, unlike Voegelin, to develop an atheist political doctrine based on several modern principles like an idea of good collapsed in individuals, does he really reject any idea of common good ? The early works of Rawls seems to underline that his thinking is not founded apart from an idea of common good or entirely part from a certain understanding of the divine. Then, we may ask if the gap between the two philosophers is as deep as it seems to be at first glance.
- Bruno Godefroy: (Lyon 3 University)
Political Theology: Legitimizing Authority after Secularization
This paper will focus on the concept of political theology as it has been used by Carl Schmitt. By analyzing different works in which he addresses the role of religion and of the Catholic church, I will show that Schmitt conceives what he calls “political theology” as a way to legitimize absolute authority in a secular context. To achieve this aim, Schmitt’s political theology removes all substantive content from Christianity and uses it only as a power structure. After uncovering the true meaning of Schmitt’s concept, I will then show that recent attempts to read Voegelin as a “political theologian” are not entirely convincing.
- Thierry Gontier: (Lyon 3 University)
Christianity as Civil Theology? Erik Peterson and Eric Voegelin
In his 1935 work, Erik Peterson shows the impossibility for Christianity to establish itself as a civil religion. Opposed to it are both the transcendence of divine power, expressed by the Trinitarian dogma, and the eschatology which forbids any attempt to secularize the Kingdom of God. In his 1952 work, Voegelin summarizes Peterson's theses. But Voegelin thinks that if the complete articulation of symbols in Christianity leads to the separation of the divine and the mundane, it also leads to a lack of meaning of the world, likely to weaken the political order. He attaches particular importance to reading authors who tried to think of Christianity as civil theology – such as Machiavelli, Hooker or Bergson.

Why Regnum Hominis Cannot be Divinized: Reflections on Augustine, Bacon and Hobbes
One of the ways which help us to understand the divinization of politics in our epoch is to inquire those constraints which impeded its advent before the modern era. I'll discuss the three authors mentioned above, especially focus on the preconditions for their political thoughts, namely, an 'augustinian' philosophical anthropology (and its calvinist variant), to show that without eliminating the idea of saeculum senescens in the perspective of history as well as both naturalizing and neutralizing the moral consequences of the Fall, it's impossible to conceive a radical immanent politics.

As Stanley Hoffmann argued, IR was born as an “American Social Science”, and the discipline’s ethnocentricity has been criticized from various localities (Hoffmann 1977; Weaver 1998; Agathangelou and Ling 2009; Shilliam 2010; Tickner & Blaney 2013). In the last couple of decades, IR scholars have started to develop self-awareness of systemic racism and coloniality not only in the transmission of knowledge, but also in the very fabric of our theoretical and empirical approaches to international relations (Odoom and Andrews 2017; Capan 2017; Zondi 2018; Acharya 2021). This theoretical move has been accompanied by social movements such as #RhodesMustFall, #BlackInTheIvory, as well as major protests in western universities.

Methodological developments and innovative designs allow scholars of comparative and American politics to shed further light on the dynamics that breed intergroup prejudice and discrimination, and ways to facilitate more favorable societal outcomes. Our panel brings together scholars who leverage a wide range of theoretical and methodological approaches to explore and answer such questions. Danny Choi will present results from a three-wave panel survey among a nationally representative sample of Kenyans, assessing the extent to which prejudice-reducing interventions and attitudes toward LGBT+ individuals are conditioned by the decisions of state institutions. Nejla Asimovic will present results from an online field experiment which explores the effect of reducing the language barrier on Facebook between members of ethnically polarized groups. Laura Paler will present a study which leverages reality TV content, to examine the role of parasocial and vicarious contact in shaping racial prejudice in the U.S. Finally, Chagai Weiss will present results from a series of field experiments, testing the effects of an educational intervention on Jewish children’s prejudice towards outgroups, and their support for diversity.",Yang-Yang Zhou University of British Columbia,"Yang-Yang Zhou University of British Columbia

Ilya Matveev’s paper uses two case studies of large enterprises that have been taken over by the Russian state to illustrate the persistence of the neoliberal paradigm in Russia, especially at the ideational level. The analysis of the neoliberal paradigm is also the subject of Nicholas Emery’s and Mitchell Orenstein’s paper. The authors argue that market economic reforms did not have a significant impact on long-run growth. Rather, the variation in growth rates is attributable to rising oil and gas revenues and lower government spending that allowed slow reformers to converge with or surpass the reform leaders’ growth rates. Wendy Leutert and Abigail Coplin turn their attention to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as they study how firms respond strategically to dual logics of market profit and political legitimacy during China’s global economic expansion. Finally, Denise van der Kamp’s paper examines regulatory uncertainty in China’s environmental policy to see whether informal ties are always better for business, especially when business contexts are highly politicized.",Marc P.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 11: Comparative Politics,,September 17,am,8:00,9:30,Working-Class Representation,"This panel features papers that examine the causes and effects of unequal class representation from multiple perspectives. Barnes, Kerevel, and Saxton use original surveys from Argentina and Mexico to study how voters evaluate working-class candidates and when do voters perceive candidates and institutions as representing class interests.

What tradeoffs do these decisions require alliance members make among their strategic interests? Which factors determine the effectiveness of these decisions at the political or operational levels?
The interplay among politics, military strategy, and tactics that rests at the heart of allied decision-making processes has long been a matter of interest to international security scholars. Yet, the increased number of civilian, military, and non-state actors with diverse stakes in any given coalition magnifies the complexity of alliance strategic decision-making in ways that existing models may be less useful to illuminate. As such, the complexities of alliance management remains a fruitful area for theoretical and empirical investigation by scholars and is thus the focus of the research presented on this panel.
For the practice of policy, too, understanding the dynamics of alliance management remains as important a task as ever. The frequency of inter- and intra-state conflict involving international coalitions remains as steady in the twenty-first century as in the twentieth. Moreover, the return of interstate multipolarity may cause some states and other armed actors to contemplate whether their current alliances continue to serve their interests. New military technologies and sources of arms are also changing whether and how external balancing strategies remain optimal for alliance members. In light of these trends, this panel presents new research leveraging novel arguments and data from a broad range of empirical cases to illuminate questions related to the processes by which alliances and their members make decisions and bargain across the policy, operational, and tactical levels.
Together, the works presented suggest that intra-alliance decision-making is often refracted through the abandonment-entrapment, delegation, and free-riding dilemmas common in coalition politics, but that these dilemmas can arise in unexpected ways across the political, strategic, and tactical levels. Barbara Elias introduces a new data set to analyze the sources of variation in how local allies in counterinsurgency wars respond to requests their patrons make with refusals, counteroffers, or agreement. Stéfanie von Hlatky uses interview and field work data to show how NATO’s delegation of implementation to the Women, Peace, and Security agenda to military organizations has led to the distortion of feminist ideas and norms Alliance members have adopted as policy. Sara Moller addresses the puzzle of why some U.S. military coalition partners in Iraq and Afghanistan rarely made operational contributions to coalition efforts that actually reflected the reasons for which Washington recruited these partners in the first place.

In this panel, we will turn the lens on modern militaries as complex systems, asking what makes them effective. We move far beyond traditional counts of materiel or assessments of balances of power based on troop numbers by investigating sources of military power that have traditionally received less attention from international relations scholars. Rosella Capella Zielinski and Ryan Grauer, for example, demonstrate how compatibility in logistics capability is essential to successful coalition-building. Tanisha Fazal, Tracey Koehlmoos, Cathaleen Madsen, and Logan Stundal will report on surveys assessing the degree to which confidence in military medicine affects military morale (note that Koehlmoos & Madsen are not in the APSA database, which is why they do not appear in the formal submission form). Renanah Miles Joyce and Brian Blankenship investigate the politics of creating US military bases in Africa, while Carla Martinez Machain, Michael Allen, and Michael Flynn write on local public opinion around US bases in Central Europe. Carrie Lee and Jonathan Caverley will serve as chair and discussant, respectively.
This panel is comprised of a diverse group of scholars. Miles Joyce, Blankenship, and Stundal are all junior scholars. Koehlmoos and Madsen approach this research from the health sciences. The papers on this panel also draw from diverse research traditions, from deep qualitative analysis to survey experiments. Caverley and Lee teach at war colleges, offering a critical perspective on this research. This range, on these multiple dimensions, represents the intellectual diversity highlighted in this year’s call for proposals.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 2: Foundations of Political Theory,,September 17,am,8:00,9:30,"Social Form and Politics: Theorizing Value, (Un)freedom, and Authority","This panel deals with the question of social form and its relationship to politics. In different ways, each of the four papers asks: how does a specific form of social organization bear on political possibility and experience? That motivating question is intimately related to this year’s conference theme of rethinking a post-pandemic political science: the ongoing pandemic has challenged prevailing norms of how Americans live and work, and these pandemic-driven changes to social organization have in turn re-cast the age-old questions of what citizens are owed by their government, what they owe to each other, and what political outcomes are possible. This makes it all the more necessary that political theorists and scientists take seriously lived social realities as they conduct their inquiries. With this theme in mind, each of the papers on this panel challenges the idea that there is a privileged position outside of politics from which to conduct critique; the four authors instead concern themselves with theorizing social form as the medium through which power, domination, and subjecthood take shape.
Rothin Datta’s paper treats Marx as a theorist of form rather than a vulgar economic determinist; in doing so, Datta opens up possibilities for theorizing the mutually constitutive relationship between political economy and social form from a Marxian perspective. Gaby Nair takes up this Marxian theme of value-as-form in her critique of structural domination in capitalist societies. Nair seeks to understand political agency as a function of capitalist forms of social organization. Soren Dudley also considers the themes of structural domination and agency, arguing that domination and depoliticization under liberal capitalism can be understood through the pathology of spectatorship. In her paper, Dudley argues that cultural experience is an important site for theorizing political possibility and subjecthood. Finally, Jordan Ecker uses Paine’s democratic theory to challenge the concept of “society” as a natural and pre-political position from which to critique politics. Ecker invites us to instead consider the messy and multi-dimensional relationship between politics and social formation in our democratic theorizing.
Though they consider different political contexts and source material, each of these papers resists a simplistic and unidirectional relationship between a truth-source– be that a mode of production, a “natural” idea of civil society, or a straightforward power dynamic between capitalists and workers– and political outcomes. Rather, authors on this panel characterize social form and political possibility as intimately bound and mutually constitutive. On this view, political theory cannot only concern itself with institutional design or normative argumentation. Political theory will have to commit itself to a serious curiosity about the social forms, experiences, and relationships through which power and politics are made manifest.",William Clare Roberts McGill University,Alexander H.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 2: Foundations of Political Theory,,September 17,am,8:00,9:30,The Ethics and Politics of Uncertainty,"Two months into the pandemic, in Spring 2020, Jürgen Habermas emphasized in separate newspaper interviews that “we have never had so much knowledge about our non-knowledge and about the necessity to act and live in conditions of uncertainty” (Frankfurter Rundschau, Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger, Le Monde). Emerging primarily from a novel sensitivity to human fragility in the face of an unknown and globally spreading virus, this claim could just as equally apply to the unpredictable effects of human-made climate crisis, the ominous ways in which humans become indistinguishable from their data, or the forays that genetic manipulation and artificial intelligence have taken into formerly divine territory: the design and creation of human life. Our panel investigates how we have historically responded to the loss of certainty and asks how the ethics and politics of uncertainty may look like in the future.
Uncertainty occupies a central place in the history of modern political thought: liberalism responded to the loss of divine omnipresence with a turn to science, technology, and the law, and related to uncertainty as a problem calculated as risk, for instance; romantic thought has traditionally confronted the loss of wholeness with an emphasis on identity and belonging; and the existentialist and postmodern literature has tended to naturalize and glorify contingency to the extent that God, absolute knowledge, or the subject no longer exist. Uncertainty is also built into democratic processes in the form of elections and the transition of power. Indeed, the outcome of politics has to be uncertain in order to be democratic. At the same time, uncertainty can contribute to the erosion of public trust in democratic institutions and give rise to popular unrest and anger.
Given the significance of uncertainty in history and politics, it is surprising that the phenomenon remains underdeveloped in political theory and practice. Our panel intends to meet this challenge and explore historical, political and normative dimensions of “the necessity to act and live in conditions of uncertainty.”
Javier Burdman asks how it is possible to speak of democratic foundations, if democracy rests on a “dissolution of the markers of certainty” (Claude Lefort). Unlike rational theories, Burdman contends that the source of universal ethical commitments is not an absolute principle but the experience of uncertainty itself. Probing a wide range of post-foundationalist perspectives, he develops the idea that we pursue ethical values not because we know they are valid, but rather because they allow us to relate to other viewpoints with different standards of validity. In a similar vein, Carmen Dege argues against rationalist attempts at finding and implementing certainty in politics and warns, in particular, of epistocratic models of governing which seek to tie power to knowledge. Embracing the advantages of a demos that changes its mind, Dege asserts that not knowing the right answer is an important defense against authoritarian claims to superiority and allows democracies to deal better with exceptional challenges. She turns to the practice of improvisation and its significance for democratic action to explore ways in which uncertainty does not lead to a fixation on certainty but a “controlled loss of control.”
Turning to debates over the role of uncertainty in the history of political thought, Roni Hirsch traces the neglected significance of probability theory and its transformation in John Stuart Mill’s economic theory. In particular, Mill played an active part in shifting 19th century probability theory from questions of subjective expectation to the calculation of collective risk. Hirsch shows the extent to which this development gave rise to a “frequentist,” class-based theory of profit which diverges from the contemporary idea of profit as a highly uncertain return. Lorenzo Zucca finally addresses the pressing question of political rule in conditions of uncertainty and finds answers in William Shakespeare and his reliance on Machiavelli’s Prince. Of particular interest is the change in the temporality of rule: A finite government questions the stability of the King’s status and implies that historical causation can no longer be primarily conceived as linear. Zucca argues that Shakepeare’s Richard II interprets Machiavelli’s virtú as the human capability to respond to changing circumstances and shapes the character of Prince Hal as a ruler uncannily resembling Machiavelli’s ideal Prince.",Davide Panagia UCLA,Adriana Alfaro Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico,"A Democratic Ethics of Uncertainty - Javier Burdman, Universidad Nacional de San Martin

Fjelde, Knutsen, Metternich and Wig chart the rise and fall of different types of “archetypical” revolutionary movements in different historical eras. Using a new global database revolutionary social movements, they document how democratization and the rise of mass-based electoral politics altered the aims and social composition of revolutionary groups. Examining a more modern historical development, Donno, Morrison and Savun focus on the post-2000 rise of non-Western election monitoring groups that challenge the verdicts more established groups. Using new data on a variety of election monitoring groups, they examine whether competing verdicts from different monitoring groups are associated with different patterns of post-election contention and violence. Turning to the micro-level dynamics of contentious electoral politics, Daxecker and Prasad theorize the conditions under which electoral violence is used either to demobilize or to polarize and mobilize voters. They test their theory using data from more than 90,000 polling booths in West Bengal India, documenting a divergence in the perpetrators and effects of election violence in opposition strongholds versus competitive districts. Finally, Von Borzyskowski and Wahman similarly explore the demobilizing effects of electoral violence, focusing on how fear of violence dampens the democratic participation of minority groups in urban Africa. Drawing from original survey data in Zambia, they show that electoral violence supports local political hegemony and reinforces political exclusion by de-mobilizing marginalized groups.",Adrienne LeBas American University,"Adrienne LeBas American University

Nojang Khatami’s paper draws on specific uses of the poetry of 14th century Sufi thinker and poet Shams ud-Dīn Muhammad Hafez to illustrate the importance of a historically and culturally contextualised approach in order to appreciate non-Western theories according to their own self-understandings and intentions. Emily Beausoleil’s paper examines ongoing efforts by Māori and non-Māori to collaboratively adapt a citizens’ assembly to an Indigenous context, the specific learning and unlearning by non-Māori crucial to this process, and the particular innovations to ‘deliberation’ that result when honouring Māori tino rangatiratanga (total political authority) is a core commitment. Asma Abbas’ paper draws on a poetics of reading based in Quranic recitation to interpret Ali Ibn Abu Talib’s sermons collected in Nahj-ul-Balagha and recordings of Allama Rashid Turabi’s lectures/majalis from the 1970s, and in doing so both maps a genealogy of ways of reading and examines the tension between political knowledge, secularism, and radical possibility. Finally, Samantha Frost generates and then explores a perspicuous contrast between Agamben’s theory of use and various Indigenous theories of relational subjectivity, in order to temper and work beyond instrumentalist, extractive dimensions of western scholarly engagement.

These urban-rural divides are linked in complex ways to long-term patterns of economic development (Rodden 2019), local institutional structures (Ogorzalek 2018, Fitzgerald 2018), and urbanization (Armstrong, Lucas, and Taylor 2021). Clearly, the emergence and character of urban-rural divides is a topic that is well-suited to comparative analysis, both within and across countries – particularly in Canada and the United States, where urban-rural divides in party support have never been larger than they are today. The authors in this panel provide important comparative analyses of the urban rural divide, with a particular (but not exclusive) focus on Canada and the United States.

How has the institutionalization of global gender norms met with countermovement? When such countermovement has occurred, to what extent has it undermined this gender-norm institutionalization? Relatedly, can we better understand the global rise of right-wing politics in the last two decades if we view it through the lens of gender? How could we conceptualize repeating and varying patterns amongst them? These papers address these questions, using cross-national comparison and case studies drawn from Latin America, East Central Europe, and East Asia (South Korea). Analyzing various qualitative and quantitative data, these papers challenge the existing studies on the anti-gender movement. First, the anti-gender movement should be understood as a new expression of persistent exclusion of gender and sexual minorities, rather than a backlash against any advancement in women’s and LGBTQ rights. Second, democratic backsliding, right-wing populism, and anti-gender movement not only undermine but, paradoxically, strengthen women’s and LGBTQ movements.",Nichole Bauer Louisiana State University,"Sonia E.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 42: Critical Political Science (formerly New Political Science),,September 17,am,8:00,9:30,"Political Science, State Violence and the Politics of Policing","Though political science has by now brought the state back in, it is still holding the police at arm’s length. Notwithstanding the discipline’s part in contributing to the growth and spread since the 1980s of aggressive methods for the surveillance and imprisonment of racialized and impoverished others, until recently political science had, in contrast to sociology and anthropology, relatively little critical to say about police as government. That is now changing, in part due to a growing awareness among political scientists that police are not at all peripheral to politics—not least of all in America (see Isaac 2015; Soss & Weaver 2017). Yet, though events of recent years—from BLM and the Trump presidency to Antifa and the transnational politics of populism—have given the political science of policing some impetus, work on race, police killings and the carceral state still has not penetrated deeply into the discipline’s debates about the fundamentals of citizenship and democracy, of alienation and authoritarianism, in the US and elsewhere.
How can policing as an object for political theoretic and political scientific inquiry engage with rudimentary questions about state formation and preservation, regime type and change? What can we learn about how politics are experienced and expressed by concentrating on the work that policing does on the body of the political subject? What do we misunderstand or overlook when we fail to do so? This panel will address these questions by interrogating the reluctance of political theory to engage with police violence; comparing recent experiences of police violence and political responses to them in the US and India; exploring how mythologies of metropolitan civilian policing are intertwined with imperial ideologies and practices; and, by arguing for empirically derived political theory of police violence through attention to how police torturers talk to their captives. Via these routes, panelists will variously explicate how power is embodied and experienced through police forces and their proxies, with what effects for political order generally, and for our research subjects and methods particularly.",Nicholas Rush Smith CUNY-City College,Keally DeAnne McBride University of San Francisco,"Police Violence and the (Unfinished) Critique of the State in Political Theory - Guillermina Seri, Union College

Yet, recent events and processes came to challenge theories advanced during the last years on the impact of these players on democracy. Using diverse methods and relying on original data, this panel updates the literature on democracy and authoritarianism in the region.
Looking at the 2021 coup in Tunisia staged by President Kais Saied, Hammami, and Kubinec et al. papers respond to the puzzling question as to why the masses and the military, previously seen as supporters of democracy, came to support democratic reversal. Hammami's paper looks at the evolution of civil-military relations as an explanatory factor. Framing the 2011 Revolution as a critical juncture, Hammami describes the development of the civilian control of the armed forces before and after the fall of the Ben Ali regime. Combining elite interviews with a social network analysis of military officers and civilian political leaders' Facebook friends, he argues that choices made during the democratic transition led to the fusion of the historically separated civilian and military sphere and paved the way to the military-backing of the 2021 coup. Analyzing data from World Value Survey, he identifies critical determinants of public acceptance of coups. In a paper co-authored with Sharan Grewal and Steven Brooke, Kubinec et al. rely on their online and offline survey to explain why voters support possible authoritarian actions, such as amending the constitution.
Gumuscu's paper also investigates a case of democratic reversal. In a study of Turkey's Islamist AKP, she questions the linearity of the inclusion-moderation thesis commonly used to explain Islamists' support of democracy, emphasizing the reversible nature of democratic habituation. Relying on extensive interviews with the party elite, her paper describes the internal diversity of the Islamist party. It presents the factional conflict between liberals and electoralists as a key determinant of Turkey's democratic trajectory.
Exploring monarchical regimes, Shalaby and Williamson's paper focuses on opposition groups adapting to the resilient authoritarian context and using the existing state institution to influence policy outcomes. Leveraging more than 15,000 legislative texts from the parliaments of Morocco, Jordan and Kuwait, they found that well-organized and strongly represented Islamist legislators were more likely than their non-Islamist counterparts to query the government on sensitive policy issues like corruption and national security.",Chantal Berman Georgetown University,Erin York Vanderbilt University,"Coup in the Making: The Drivers of Latent Anti-Democratic Attitudes in Tunisia - Robert Kubinec, Princeton University; Sharan Grewal, College of William & Mary; Steven Brooke, University of Wisconsin- Madison

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 44: Democracy and Autocracy,,September 17,am,8:00,9:30,The Institutions and Civic Virtues That Support Democracy,"Democracy has come under severe pressure in recent years. At least 25 countries, making up 34% of the world's population, have according to the 2021 Democracy Report of the Varieties of Democracy Institute been affected by the ""third wave of autocratization"". Many other countries have fortunately avoided this fate, but nonetheless display worrying increases in institutional distrust, electoral apathy, and political polarization. This timely panel brings together four papers that help us better understand how the institutions and civic virtues that undergird well-functioning democratic institutions arise and can be strengthened.
Democracy can only function if citizens actively participate in the electoral process. Tine Paulsen, Kenneth Scheve, and David Stasavage examine to what extent better education can increase electoral engagement. To answer this question they examine the long run effect of the introduction of ""common school"" funds in the United States at the turn of the 19th century.
Research in comparative politics has long suggested that democracy is more difficult to sustain under conditions of extreme political polarization. Sam van Noort uses a survey experiment to examine whether political polarization in the United States can be reduced by better informing people about the content of scientific evidence. More in particular, van Noort examines whether informing citizens about why scientists believe that human-caused climate change and systemic racism are real, rather than only informing citizens that scientists believe this is the case, can reduce polarization on these two key policy issues.
Democratic stability fundamentally relies on the legitimacy of democracy as a political system. Jan Vogler examines to what extent trust in democracy is determined by the quality of public services that are provided by a country' public administration, and, conversely, whether poor public service provision can cause democracy to lose legitimacy in the eyes of the general public.
At its very minimum democracy entails the populace selecting their political leaders through competitive elections. Adriane Fresh examines how the political institution of leadership contests originated in the first place. To do so she collects novel data from 1400 to 1700 England and Wales, where such institutions were first systematically recorded.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 45: Human Rights,,September 17,am,8:00,9:30,The Politics of Compliance with International Legal Obligations,"This panel brings together four papers that offer original data and novel perspectives on the politics of compliance with international legal obligations. The papers examine diverse areas of law, but share underlying themes, notably that all four examine compliance politics in settings far away from formal court rooms. Montal & Pauselli look at geographical distance specifically, advancing the literature on domestic compliance with human rights obligations by using Geographic Information Systems to assess how the location of actors seeking to gather and disseminate evidence of abuses, shame, lobby or litigate influences compliance with the recommendations of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. The other papers look at compliance politics in IHL trainings (Creamer & Ozcan), on the battlefield (Kreutzer & Timbs), and in a messy transnational landscape where private actors use tools ranging from secret diplomatic negotiations to asset seizure in third countries (Berge, St John, and Stiansen).
The papers also set up interesting comparisons by examining how the same concepts operate in different areas of law. Two papers examine how varying interpretations matter for compliance: Creamer & Ozcan employ novel data on international humanitarian law training providers to investigate how military actors understand their international legal obligations, while Berge et al. employ novel data on compliance with investor-state dispute settlement awards to investigate how inconsistent adjudication influences compliance with obligations. How non-state actors shape compliance is the focus of both Creamer & Ozcan as well as Kreutzer & Timbs, who shift the attention from states to rebel group’s human rights commitments and investigate the effectiveness of different types of commitments.",Erik Voeten Georgetown University,Anibal Perez-Linan University of Notre Dame,"Compliance with Inconsistent Awards - Tarald Gulseth Berge, University of South-Eastern Norway; Taylor St John, University of St Andrews; Øyvind Stiansen, University of Oslo

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 48: Health Politics & Health Policy,,September 17,am,8:00,9:30,The Financialization of U.S. Health Care,"Healthcare in the United States is increasingly becoming “financialized.” “Financialization” is a concept developed in a corpus of literature across a number of fields that explores the process by which “financial institutions and markets increase in size and influence,” and is supported by extensive empirical evidence showing a “rising proportion of income in most countries is being captured by the financial sector (UNCTAD 2015).” The causes driving the process of financialization are wide-ranging, since the financial market itself encompasses a broad swathe of banks and investors, investment types, and publicly and privately traded financial instruments, including everything from stock exchanges to derivatives and futures trading. Financialization not only describes financial market influence over the economy and the marketplace, but also extends to non-market processes and institutions. Scholars have provided evidence of the expansion of financial markets beyond the market realm and into social policy including pensions, housing, and in some countries, in healthcare (see Lavinas 2017; Krippner 2011). The scholarship on the broader process of financialization are guideposts pointing to a variety of threats and concerning developments impacting healthcare in the U.S. This panel presents research on financialization processes in the U.S. healthcare system including its impact on health care outcomes, provider organizations, health policy and politics. Grogan and Laugesen focus on Private Equity’s (PE) role in the health care system and argue that its growth depends heavily on public subsidies of health care coverage and services, especially in certain sectors such as behavioral health care, and this dependence fuels its political power. Borsa examines the prevalence and performance of PE-affiliated fertility practices in the U.S. as part of larger expansion strategies across sexual and reproductive health. Bruch studies how access to capital is a fundamental cause of population health, and Scott analyzes how the increased focus on value-based payments as a health reform idea has been reified by key leaders in the health care finance industry.",Michael S Sparer Columbia University,John E McDonough Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health,"Financialization of Health Politics - Colleen M.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 52: Migration & Citizenship,,September 17,am,8:00,9:30,Exploring Identity and Deservingness in Migration Policy,"Central to debates on state and citizen responses to migration are questions about who is deserving of rights and how various governmental institutions can productively engage with migration given the often politicized nature of the issue. For example, who counts as a refugee? Are migrants labeled as ‘refugees’ more deserving of aid than other migrants? Who deserves voting and citizenship rights? How do politicians manipulate these debates? This panel addresses these questions from multiple angles, examining migrants’ own understandings of questions of labels and deservedness, host community attitudes towards migrants, and politicians’ manipulation of migrant policy for political gain. The papers use a range of empirical approaches, including cross national survey data, survey experiments, and qualitative interview and content analysis across cases in the Middle East and North Africa, Latin America, and Europe. Peters et al. use original survey and experimental data to interrogate how displaced Syrians, Iraqis and Venezuelans understand the label of ‘refugee’ and who they think is deserving of assistance. Using a randomized control trial of two aid programs, Woldemikael et al. examine how aid sharing between refugees and host communities affects support for refugees. Through an analysis of parliamentary debates, political platforms and interviews with opposition politicians in Turkey and the European Union, Norman and Irgil examine the often overlooked connections between international migration diplomacy and domestic politics, demonstrating the transformative effects of migration diplomacy for domestic politics and electoral competition across Global South states. Finally, using cross-sectional and original survey data, Marasa and Alarian examine whether political rights afforded to immigrants affect Europeans’ attitudes toward immigrants and immigration. Taken together, these papers further academic debates on attitudes towards migration and migration diplomacy, and their findings can help inform policy approaches to refugees assistance and migrant rights.",Stephanie Schwartz London School of Economics,"Rebecca Hamlin University of Massachusetts, Amherst","Who's Deserving?

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 6: Political Economy,,September 17,am,8:00,9:30,The Politics of Credit Claiming,"This panel brings together papers that ask how and which politicians engage in credit-claiming activities. With evidence from Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, Aspinall, Weiss, Hicken, and Hutchcroft develop a theory of the conditions under which elected politicians will engage in programmatic versus patronage politics, with credit-claiming as a useful strategy in single-party polities but dominated by morselization in competitive states. Within a given political context, Diaz, Oliveros, Weitz-Shapiro, and Winters use experimental evidence from Argentina to test whether gender affects politicians’ ability to effectively claim credit for government programs. On another identity dimension, O’Brien-Udry tests how ethnic politics mediates credit-attribution to local politicians for foreign aid programs using a conjoint experiment on minority and majority respondents in Kosovo. Finally, Ijaz questions whether credit-claiming aptly describes the activities of politicians who actively provide information to their constituents about public programs, suggesting instead that this information serves an important function in enabling “last-mile” access to under-informed citizens. The collected papers put forward important nuance about credit-claiming activities across a broad array of countries. Together, the papers suggest that credit-claiming is not a blunt instrument for politicians but a tool that must be carefully calibrated to socio-political contexts.",Cleo Marie O'Brien-Udry Yale University,"Natalia Salgado Bueno Emory University

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 7: Politics and History,,September 17,am,8:00,9:30,Colonial America and American Political Development,"The panel addresses how the political, social, religious, economic, and intellectual history of Britain’s North American colonies vitally inform us of American political development, where political scientists and APD scholars in particular have effectively ignored the colonial experience.
The four papers address the distinct legacies and implications of the British colonial rule in North America.
“The Unknown Founding,” by Bartholomew Sparrow, establishes the political impact of the immigration to the American colonies of hundreds of thousands of Europeans—a majority of colonists—who could not pay for their passage, were exiled as convicts and political prisoners, or who were abductees. European-American bonded servants have been studied extensively by a number of students of the American colonies, the British Empire, and the Atlantic World, but this “class” element has been missing from accounts of the Founding, the framers’ own lives, and American political development. The paper (a draft article) relies on archival and primary sources, on textual analyses of the Declaration, Articles of Confederation, US Constitution, and Federalist Papers, on primary and secondary research on lives of the framers, and on the extensive literature on colonial America and the Founding Era to show the prevalence of property-based colonial hierarchy and political discrimination among European Americans dating back to Jamestown and extending into the nineteenth century.
“The Family and the State: Colonial and APD Perspectives,” by Eileen McDonagh, examines the family and the state as analogous institutions. For James I, political rulers were the “parents of the people,” according to the kingship theory of the state. This view was accepted by American colonists who expected the English monarchs to be “good parents,” even as increasing dissatisfaction with British policies prompted growing numbers of American colonists to think of British monarchs as “bad parents.” The paper therefore explores how the American Revolution destroyed the kingship state theory, to be replaced by the liberal theory of the state which separates the family and the state into private and public spheres and which does not ever consider political rulers as parents. The paper analyzes the consequences of this binary regime reformulation for American political development in general and the development
of a welfare state in particular.
The third paper on the panel, “Whither the vortex?: The antecedents and implications of power migration across branches,” considers the evidence and reasoning used by the Antifederalists and Federalists to back their disparate claims. The former group held that either executives or the elite Senate would aggrandize power, whereas the latter warned that popular legislatures are an ""impetuous vortex."" Both cited political theories to support their claims. With passage of time, we are now in a position to at once assess their different claims and point out the lessons we can learn about how to maintain a system of government that separates powers.
Fourthly, “Fiction, State Building and Education Reform: Political Legacies from the Eighteenth Century,” by Cathie Jo Martin, offers a comparative angle to the panel. Her paper explores how cultural projects in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries had long-term legacies for political development. Fiction writers and their literary works were central to the cultural projects associated with nation-building and their early contributions to the foundation of national corpora of literature created crucial political legacies. Specifically authors created symbols and narratives about state, society and class that were reused and reworked by future generations. The assumptions embedded in these fictional works helped to shape future discourse over social and political problems. The paper uses computational linguistics methods and process tracing to shed light on authors’ contributions to education reform in Britain, Denmark and France.",Bartholomew H.

Should these devices be reserved for constitutional issues or used on a variety of ordinary legislation? Are these devices associated with substantive political commitments? How should they interact with other democratic institutions, such as parliaments or deliberative mini-publics? Can these devices contribute to democracy by addressing issues such as corruption and non-responsiveness? Or are their alleged shortcomings – a lack of accountability or elite manipulation – too significant to be overcome?

Full Paper Panel,NA,Related Groups / Politica: Society for the Study of Medieval Thought,,September 17,am,8:00,9:30,Political Bodies: Whole and Divided,"The themes of wholeness and unity pervaded political thought during the Latin Middle Ages, often expressed in terms such as the body politic and the corpus mysticum. This panel considers some aspects of how Western Christian thinkers encountered and dissected the myriad issues posed to political thinkers by organic cohesion from the perspectives of metaphor (Karen Bollermann), theology (Mary Keys), ecclesio-politics (Frank Godthardt), and religious liberty (Catherine Kuiper) perspectives. For Bollermann, intriguing constraints are present in the extent to which John of Salisbury was prepared to extend his body politic analogy, especially in light of the medical paradigms on his age. In Keys’s view, medieval Christian thought has been misrepresented in its supposed emphasis on care of the soul at the expense of care for the body and the political implications thereof. Godthardt examines how the divided body of Christiandom between the Eastern and Western churches informs the political theory of Marsilius of Padua. Kuiper focuses on how two prominent medieval thinkers grapple with the fraught issues for religious liberty that arise from the enforcement of Christian orthodoxy on the basis of baptism alone. All of these papers center on the negotiation of whether, how, and to what extent political bodies (broadly conceived) can subsist and even thrive in the face of division and disunity.","Jason Maloy University of Louisiana, Lafayette",Bettina Koch Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,"Of Balls and Feet: John of Salisbury's Galenic Body Politic - Karen Bollermann, Independent Scholar

Full Paper Panel,NA,Related Groups / Southeast Asian Politics,,September 17,am,8:00,9:30,Myanmar Identity Politics in the Shadow of Military Rule,"Myanmar’s February 2021 coup represented a watershed moment in the country’s history, igniting renewed conflict and ushering in an uncertain future. In addition to bringing Myanmar’s nascent democratization to a screeching halt, the coup further exacerbated longstanding ethnic and identity-based tensions. Armed conflict flared in areas where it was previously dormant, and the military accelerated its efforts to employ ethnonationalist propaganda in service of self-preservation. These dynamics reflect continuity with previous decades of military rule and have supercharged concerns about outgroup intolerance raised during the preceding years of political transition.
This panel brings together early-career scholars with in-depth country expertise to explore these issues over time through a diverse set of methodological approaches. Constant Courtin uses Bayesian logic and process tracing to assess whether ethnic grievance or a security dilemma best explains the outbreak of the Kayin insurgency early in the country’s history. Two papers focus on Myanmar’s decade of transition. Oren Samet and Aila Matanock explore the relationship between Facebook use and intergroup tolerance through an analysis of nationally representative survey data collected just after the 2017 Rohingya genocide. Employing in-depth fieldwork and a unique dataset, Megan Ryan examines how military networks affect the relationship between the military and nationalist activists before the 2015 elections. Turning to the post-coup environment, Isabel Chew and Jangai Jap employ a survey experiment to probe the extent to which shared experiences can help mitigate prejudice against outgroups, looking in particular at attitudes toward the Rohingya. Ardeth Thaunghmung and Renard Sexton will serve as chair and discussant, bringing a wealth of thematic, case-specific, and methodological expertise to the discussion.
In addition to diving deep into Myanmar’s history and contemporary politics, the papers also use Myanmar as a case to build broader theories about the determinants of elite and public attitudes around issues of identity. The panel’s temporal diversity reflects the endurance of ethnic and identity-based tension and conflict, from independence, to the transition under both military-backed and National League for Democracy governments, to the current post-coup environment. It also reflects the importance of analyzing past and present together in order to better assess prospects for the future.",Joel Sawat Selway Brigham Young University,"Dotan Haim Florida State University

Virtual Created Panel,NA,Division 25: Public Policy,,September 17,am,8:00,9:30,Tracing Actor and Frame Interdependence in Global Policy Networks (Virtual Session),"The papers in this panel aim to create a new research agenda that studies the relationships between actors and frames in networks. They investigate when and how specific statements emerge in a policy debate, by which kinds of actors they are proposed, and whether and how they diffuse to others. The panel makes empirical, theoretical and methodological contributions, by bringing together papers that study framing networks in three major global policy areas and discussing methodological advancements in Discourse Network Analysis (DNA).
A common focus on actor and frame networks:
Political actors do not present issues objectively. They use ‘schemata of interpretation’, or ‘frames’ as our collection of papers call them, in order to locate, perceive, identify, and label occurrences within their life space and the world at large. The ways actors frame issues are shown to matter in public policy. There is a large body of work that looks into the impact of frames and specifically why some frames might be more influential than others. However, this literature neglects the framing process itself. In this panel, we study dynamic frame production processes, which involve a highly interdependent network of actors and frames.
A comparative research question:
The research question that unites the papers assembled in this panel is ‘Where do frames come from?’. This primary question is accompanied by several secondary research questions. These focus on identifying the actors involved in the emergence and diffusion of individual frames, tracing the networks they are involved in, understanding why actors choose the political arguments they use, the measurement of the centrality, or relative importance, of frames or arguments, as well as studying the institutional norms they are embedded in or conflict with.
Importantly, the individual papers analyse these questions comparatively, by studying eight global policy debates relating to environment, health, migration and transparency. All of the cases explored by our panelists build on the premise that framing occurs mostly in contested issue areas and thereby focuses conflictual policy fields.
A common theoretical perspective:
To answer the research question motivating the panel, our papers rely on complex systems theory. A complex system is commonly defined as a system in which large networks of components with no central control and simple rules of operations give rise to complex collective behaviour, sophisticated information processing and adaptation via learning or evolution. Political debates share all the characteristics of complex adaptive systems as they are made of political actors and ideas of various types, and these actors and ideas interoperate at different levels. Analysing policy debates as networks through complex adaptive systems is a nascent and promising avenue of research.
The four papers in this panel present both complementary and contradictory findings and would discuss the following hypotheses related to frame emergence and discourse networks. First, new frames are more likely to emerge where there is a high concentration and high diversity of statements, and actors who are more likely to construct new frames are those connected to a wide variety of frames in discourse networks. Second, the first frames are likely to have a structural effect for later frames, and this effect is likely related to the discourse networks among the concerned actors. Third, frames connecting previously disconnected cluster of frames are more likely to be transformative than others. The papers also explore the institutional, political and historical context in which new frames emerge, in particular (changes in) power dynamics shaping international organizations or the existence of transnational advocacy networks promoting new norms, ideas and frames.
A common methodological approach:
We adopt a mixed-methods approach combining discourse network analysis and parametric statistical network analysis to study the highly interdependent network of actors and frames. All papers use Discourse Network Analysis to trace the lifecycle of individual frames, when and how they emerge, by whom they are proposed, and where they diffuse in a given policy debate. They all use content and network analysis of a set of unique and original datasets that bring together thousands of documents from selected global policy debates.
Papers:
The first three papers focus on framing patterns in three major global policy dilemmas (framing networks on environmental politics, on human data sharing and on human commodification).

However, global power shifts and domestic contestation call into question established narratives about domestic underpinnings of US foreign policy. How do interbranch dynamics evolve in transformative times and does a challenging international environment consolidate or perhaps even erode presidential leadership? This panel addresses this important and timely area of study from a variety of connected perspectives. Melinda Haas assesses congressional oversight of covert action and aims to better understand when Congress will act to regulate covert action through law, and what form those laws will take. Jane Darby Menton draws on democratic theory of representation and exposes an overlooked power discrepancy between levels of analysis: incumbent administrations are uniquely authorized to speak for the state at the international level, but legitimacy is negotiated at the domestic level, where authority is more contested and diffuse. Gordon Friedrichs turns to the polarization of US alliances in response to global power shifts and differentiates between ideological and affective polarization, investigating the extent and specific foreign policy consequences of each dimension of polarization.

Waight and her co-authors examine the extent to which news is government-directed and its subsequent implications. Drawing on a database of six million newspaper articles, leaked propaganda directives, and case studies, they find increased state propaganda coordination that results in crowding out information of public interest. MacDonald and Cao deploy a survey experiment to uncover that receptivity to new propaganda messages is mediated by the frameworks and psychological processes that one holds. Scoggins analyzes public perceptions of police propaganda on social media through a mixed methods approach, revealing state propaganda adaptation in the digital age and its apparent effectiveness. Adopting a quasi-natural experiment design, Zhan and Chen analyze survey data coinciding two waves of digital surveillance projects, finding that while newly introduced digital surveillance can generate fear and induce compliance among citizens, such effect wanes over time and may even backfire in the long run.

This panel's papers contribute to these debates, by taking on questions that expose and complicate the processes under which institutions enable and incentivize agency among mobilized ethnic groups (through the lens of civil society and social mobilization), but also the conditions whereby institutions restrict expression or privilege some elements of ethnic agency over others. With a focus on Central and Eastern Europe and East Asia, and using a variety of methodological approaches, the included papers provide an opportunity to examine in-depth the merits and weaknesses of institutional impacts on ethnic identity expression, popular mobilization, and effects on policy making.",Harris Mylonas George Washington University,Gulnaz Sharafutdinova King's College London,"Minority Institutions and Interethnic Relations - Zsuzsa Csergo, Queen's University; Olga Talal, Queen's University; Tamas Kiss, Romanian Institute for Research on National Minorities

And what methodologies are required to enable feminists today to fruitfully engage with historical works? This panel proposes to explore the various means by which both historians of political thought and theorists of contemporary feminist political theory can draw on intellectual history, to better understand feminism and interrogate our own present problems and solutions.

This panel mines works of Greek political thinkers as enduring resources for understanding the relationship between the politics of rule (archē) and the nature of constitutions or regimes (politeiai), focusing especially on the relationship between rule and the supervision of rulers, the exclusionary underpinnings of civic membership, and the logic of mastery shared between tyrants in the polis as well as the oikos. The questions that animate the panel revolve around theorizing what rule is and how it was conceived in ancient Greece, as well as how it operated in classifying and thinking through various types of regimes. In so doing, these papers employ a diverse range of interpretive approaches, from contextualist strategies that locate arguments in time, to fine-grained treatments of syntax and argumentation, to examinations of thematic and rhetorical continuities that span different texts, while sharing a common interest in theorizing the nature of political power and community.
We bring together papers by junior and senior scholars which share a concern with rule and regime both in their theoretical conceptions and their practical applications within the Greek context. Silvia Fedi looks to the two Platonic cities of Kallipolis and Magnesia as using the theme of rule by women and female political participation to offer insight about the nature of rule itself. Melissa Lane studies the ways in which Plato’s Guardians rule the Kallipolis, specifically as they oversee the work of the auxiliaries within discrete terms dictated by the laws. Jordan Jochim offers a reading of Aristotle which draws parallels between his concepts of tyranny and that of mastery not simply based on a self-interested logic of rule, but on the injustice of tyranny and mastery in the eyes of the tyrannized. Finally, Joel Schlosser engages with the figure of Diogenes of Sinope, narrated by Diogenes Laertius, as proposing a theory of “cynical rule” that is articulated before the creation of categories of political membership or belonging.",Ella Street Cornell University,Matthew Simonton,"Gender and Rule in Plato’s (Im)Perfect Cities - Silvia Fedi, University of Chicago

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 11: Comparative Politics,,September 17,am,10:00,11:30,Corruption in Latin America and Beyond,"This panel examines the political dynamics of corruption in Latin America and beyond. A growing body of scholarship investigates corruption and accountability, but some relevant questions related to the causes and consequences of political and bureaucratic corruption remain underexplored. When is corruption investigated? What are the consequences of corruption convictions on citizens’ attitudes? Why do voters sometimes ignore a politician’s corrupt record and prefer to vote for candidates of the same party or kinship? How do citizens evaluate bureaucratic corruption? What incentives and constraints do anticorruption regulators face when investigating and prosecuting corruption? Drawing from a variety of methodological approaches, this panel sheds light on the factors that shape corruption and anticorruption dynamics around the world, with an emphasis in Latin America.
The papers in this panel address these theoretical questions by using different methodological approaches. First, Kasahara, Hidalgo, and Boas use original data on politicians, focus groups, and a survey vignette experiment to investigate the functioning of patrimonialism in Brazil, which helps explain why informal practices like corruption or clientelism persist in the country. Second, Gehrke and Yang use public opinion data from across the world to analyze how people respond to political leaders convicted for corruption. Third, Lagunes takes stock of what we know about the incentives that anticorruption regulators face when investigating and prosecuting corruption. Finally, Carreras, Vera, and Visconti use a conjoint experiment in Paraguay to explore how citizens respond to the corruption they encounter in their everyday life when interacting with public servants. Combined, these four papers work together to analyze key aspects of the forces that shape the dynamics of corruption across the world.",Rebecca Weitz-Shapiro Brown University,"Nara Pavão UFPE

Our political history is as old as our species, extending several hundred thousand years into the past. If one’s purview is limited to state forms of political organization that history extends back to the ancient polities of Mesopotamia, Egypt, and China, founded in the fourth millennium BCE.
Meanwhile, the social science disciplines focus steadfastly on politics in the contemporary era, occasionally extending their purview back to the nineteenth century. That is what we study. Likewise, the literature we build upon derives mostly from the postwar era. With the exception of a few acknowledged classics (Aristotle, Machiavelli, Weber, Smith, Marx et al.), it is rare to cite earlier work. Accordingly, our understanding of politics is based on a tiny sliver of political history, a mere two generations or – in “historical” studies – as many as seven generations. We stare obsessively through a tiny aperture.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 11: Comparative Politics,Division 46: Qualitative Methods,September 17,am,10:00,11:30,"Evolving Concepts in Comparative Politics: Coups, Crises, and Democracy","Recent years have seen an important trend toward conceptual change, as stark, “dramatic” terms such as coup, crisis, fascism, etc. have been employed beyond their initial strictly defined extension and have been applied to less clear-cut instances; for instance, scholars have called rightwing populism a la Trump some version of fascism. Does this broader, looser usage of concepts constitute inappropriate “conceptual stretching,” which per Sartori (1970) should be avoided? Or does it reflect productive conceptual evolution and adaptation of scholars’ conceptual apparatus in light of important political changes? For instance, normative progress has foreclosed the reemergence of full-scale fascism, so that preserving this concept may justify applying it to instances of proto-fascism or pre-fascism. Alternatively, recent challenges to liberal democracy may induce concerned academics to use dramatic terms more broadly in order to alert civil society to new risks through powerful warnings. Thus, for analytical or normative reasons, 21st century politics may call for a broadening of concept usage.
The proposed panel seeks to elucidate these crucial issues through in-depth examinations of recent changes in the usage of major concepts, such as coup, crisis, and fascism. In these ways, the paper authors will map definitional trends and elucidate the changing meaning of notions that are central to contemporary scholarly analysis. Moreover, panel participants take different positions on the underlying debate. Whereas some of us criticize recent modifications as conceptual stretching and advocate a return to rigorous classical categorization a la Sartori, others highlight the benefits of conceptual evolution, which does better justice to the changing realities of contemporary politics and helps identify and counteract recent threats to liberal pluralism as well.","Kurt Weyland University of Texas, Austin","Sheri Berman Barnard College, Columbia University

Ben Ross Schneider Massachusetts Institute of Technology","Discussant: Kanta Murali, University of Toronto
In contrast to analysts who predicted that globalization would drive the homogenization of economic policy, the past decade has seen a diversification of strategies for economic development. Our panel will investigate the causes and consequences of varieties of economic reform within India using sectoral level analysis. The composition of the panel is based on a shared research design that compares the dynamics of economic policymaking across sectors of the Indian economy. The subnational comparison enables us to hold macroeconomic policy, political institutions, and political actors constant while illuminating key variables driving variation in the trajectories of reform
Each paper will examine the factors shaping economic policy at four levels, paying particular attention to how factors at different levels interact. The levels include:
1. The international level, particularly, international institutions and international networks using “weaponized interdependence”
2. The national level, including political institutions, such as legislatures and legal systems, party systems, political coalitions, macroeconomic institutions, and national developmental strategies.
3. Sectoral policy networks or the system of government agencies, private sector economic actors, and civil society organizations including business associations, think tanks, and non-governmental organizations that participate in the formulation and/or implementation of policies
4. Sectoral economic structures comprising a) the industrial structure, especially the number and relative strength of firms and the forms of competition; b) the nature of the production process and the risks that it entails; c) the nature and strategies of sectoral firms; and d) the nature and scope of international linkages.

This paper develops the analytical framework for the panel. It then argues that structured comparisons between sectoral dynamics offer insights into the mechanisms shaping different reform trajectories. It uses insights from the panel’s papers and other sectoral studies to speculate about causal factors shaping varieties of reforms.
Dinsha Mistree, Stanford University, and Rehana Mohammed, UNDP, “Comparing Advantages in India’s Computer Hardware and Software Sectors”
Why is India a global leader in computer software, but a laggard in hardware? We argue that uneven outcomes between hardware and software are due to the interaction of sectoral economic traits and state capacity. The computer hardware industry has substantial upfront investment costs requiring state protection while early-stage software does not. Effective economic protection in India requires the coordination of multiple agencies. We show that the ineffectiveness of the Indian state’s efforts to protect the hardware industry due to its inability to coordinate its agencies limited its success while not impeding the development of software.
Sunila S. Kale, University of Washington, “Mining your business: the politics of development in India’s mineral belt”
As an array of private actors enter the pitheads and plumb new open cast mines, conflicts between the social and environmental needs of displaced and peripheral communities and the economic interests of firms have become only more pronounced. The tension is acute because India’s most mineral-wealthy districts remain the country’s most impoverished ones. The Indian state has attempted to mitigate the tension by implementing corporate social responsibility (CSR) mandates requiring firms to fund development around mining operations and by mandating District Mineral Funds that collect 10-30% of the value of minerals taken from a district for its development. This paper will analyze the politics that produced these measures and whether the losers in the sector benefit from them.
Rohit Chandra, Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, “Out with the Old in with the New? The Indian Public Sector's Role in the Energy Transition,”
The Indian state has controlled the energy sector through state-owned enterprises since the 1950s. Recently, the sector has gradually opened to new competition. As global and domestic incentives motivate an energy transition away from fossil fuels, many old energy SOEs (Coal India, NTPC, Indian Oil, state discoms, etc.) face existential challenges from private firms and new SOEs that are becoming preferred vehicles for a procurement-based jumpstart to the energy transition. This paper examines the political economy of India’s energy transition as the balance between private firms, new SOE’s, and old SOE’s is transformed.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 17: International Collaboration,,September 17,am,10:00,11:30,Power Politics: Stumbling or Building Blocks of International Organizations?,"The rise of the great powers brings fundamental change in world politics, and power politics manifested itself through various institutional arrangements for the past few years. For instance, China’s influence over WHO and vaccine diplomacy calls into question the role of IO independence for cooperation. The US-China trade war also challenges the legitimacy of WTO and its multilateral ruling on intellectual property rights protection. Similarly, Russia's veto power casts doubt on whether UN could meet its objectives against crises surrounding states in the Eastern Europe. This series of events reaffirms that powerful nations still remain as the major stakeholders in IOs, whose competing interests are likely to become a `stumbling block’ for international cooperation. As Abbott and Snidal (1998) famously suggest, however, “powerful states structure such organizations to further their own interests but must do so in a way that induces weaker states to participate’’. Then how can we reconcile this conventional wisdom with what we observe in the events? How do weak states promote their own interests in IOs, and when does power politics turn into a `building block’ of IOs? Towards a post-pandemic political science research, our panel suggests these questions merit further discussion at the turning point, and four junior scholars present their findings addressing these inquiries from different angles.
In “Diplomatic Capital and Legislative Strategies in the UN”, Sabrina Arias studies whether new diplomatic means allow weak states to represent their interests in IOs. Constructing an original dataset, the author finds that diplomatic capital helps weak states advance their preferences through legislative activities in the UN. In “Who Reports Disease Outbreaks? When Interdependence Meets IO Independence”, Zoe Ge investigates how IO independence induces more compliance from weak members. Using both a theoretical model and empirical analyses, the author finds that countries with weak political linkages to the US comply more after the WHO reform on health regulation. In “Compounding or Diminishing? External Regulatory Pressures on Domestic IP Regimes”, Siyao Li examines how states’ compliance with the WTO agreement on intellectual property (TRIPS) affects bilateral channels of cooperation. Introducing a new measure, the author finds that states’ compliance with TRIPS diminishes the return to unilateral pressures. In “Reputation as a Binding Constraint : How States Navigate TRIPS Flexibilities”, Sojun Park studies how the trade remedies available in TRIPS allow weak states to defend their interests against coercion. Using a new dataset, the author finds that states under pressure for concession in bilateral trade negotiations explore more escape clauses than others.",Edward D.

What are international orders, and how are they created and changed? This panel convenes four scholars that bring diverse theoretical perspectives and methodologies to answer these questions.
Goodhart examines the strategies available to hierarchs (hegemons and empires) to legitimate their position in the order. Hierarchs face a trade-off between performance legitimation (which enables orders to grow and incorporate diverse members) and ideological or identity-based legitimation strategies which make orders more durable but limit how much they can grow without coercion.
Kalaycioglu explores how the production of the concept of “humanity” creates and shapes the terms of the international order. She offers a reminder that the production of this shared humanity is often done by excising violent histories, and its process is often Eurocentric. She illustrates these arguments by tracing the nomination of “contentious cultural sites” as sites of shared humanity, such as the Hiroshima Peace Memorial or the African Liberation Heritage Sites.
Lascurettes provides a conceptual discussion of international orders and interrogates the common proposition that the LIO is distinct and superior to other historical or hypothetical alternatives. He argues that this proposition is misguided, and his discussion serves to separate elements of the LIO that will remain robust from those that will come under increasing strain.
Lin examines why rising powers like China seek to revise the existing international order. Contrary to the conventional wisdom which points to misrecognition from established powers at the top of the hierarchy, he instead suggests that discontent starts at the bottom, emerging from status disputes between rising powers and smaller states.
Together, these manuscripts produce insights about how international orders are created and changed. The findings will be especially relevant to debates about the future of the liberal international order.","David A.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 2: Foundations of Political Theory,,September 17,am,10:00,11:30,Forays in More-than-Human Politics,"Ursula Le Guin’s memorable rallying cry against the dominant political economy may also serve as a provocation to the dominant political ecology of our time. “We live in capitalism,” Le Guin said, “its power seems inescapable—but then, so did the divine right of kings.” As political theorists and artists both know, a precondition for the downfall of any regime of power and sense—whether it be regi-centric, capital-centric, and-or anthropo-centric—is the availability of new narratives, imaginaries, sensibilities, and sensoria. Hence Le Guin’s insistence that “resistance and change often begin in art,” to which we also might add minor or overlooked traditions in literature, ontology, science, and philosophy of religion. Drawing from these sources, this panel experiments with novel theories and practices of more-than-human politics, exploring how such novelties might be nurtured into being and to what possible effect.
The ambition of the panel is twofold. First, the panelists explore, each in their own way, how and why more-than-human politics can be said to describe more than the integration of nonhumans into categories and activities often reserved for privileged humans alone; it also requires renegotiating the evolving relation of human to nonhuman, and thus reconceptualizing conventional political questions and concerns—for example, causality, normativity, and justice. Such efforts are urgently needed not only in the face of our multiple entwined ecological crises, but also because a degraded image of the nonhuman continues to justify egregious oppressions based upon race, class, gender, sexuality, ability, and faith.
The panel’s second ambition is to discuss how engagement with these challenges can provide new building blocks for the making and re-making of new worlds that are both more inclusive and attentive to the multiple ecological crises that face contemporary societies. Beginning from the presupposition that agency is both heterogeneous and distributed, the papers enter into this discussion with a shared commitment to entanglement over hyper-separation; pluralism over dualism; and emergence over linear causality. Alongside this outlook, the papers envision processes of renegotiation and reconceptualization to be themselves participatory and thus not fully subject to human control. Forays into more-than-human politics are in that sense essentially experimental, and carry both great promise and unavoidable risk.
White's essay aligns the BLM movement with religious naturalism—showing how BLM’s “uncompromising demand that black lives be viewed and treated as intrinsically valuable life forms” expresses religious naturalism’s relational ontology—and outlines several unique contributions BLM can make to a more-than-human politics that affirms the intrinsic value of materiality as such. Bennett also draws from an earthy naturalism, one she finds in Lucretius and Michel Serres. Her essay elucidates a specific kind of causality—what she terms the “it depends”—and shows how this nuanced and complex effectivity points the way to new, more-than-human models of “(deliberate) political action or intervention.” Finally, Erev and Tønder’s essay wades into “field philosophy,” reporting on a role experiment in more-than-human politics through the lens of a vitalism found in the work of Georges Canguilhem and others. Their joint “foray” focuses in particular on the political effectivity of performance—on how even a staged simulation can transform what and how participants think, desire, and act and how such transformations might in turn be transmitted to even larger more-than-human publics.","Morton Schoolman SUNY, University at Albany","Brian Massumi Universite de Montreal

Local governments are central actors in the debates over policing, housing, infrastructure, public health, and other crucial policy areas. Yet, voter turnout in local elections is extremely low compared to national contests and only ten percent of local elected officials are people of color compared to 23 percent in Congress.
Unique electoral institutions and policies may lie at the heart of these disparities. Local elections are often held “off-cycle,” taking place on different dates than national and state contests. Many local elections are legally non-partisan, preventing ballots from disclosing candidates’ party identification. Some local governments are structured using regional districts, some use at-large representatives, while others use a combination of both. Recent research has leveraged growing public data on local governments to better understand how these institutions shape participation, vote choice, and representation (Warshaw 2019). However, many questions regarding how local political institutions shape democratic representation remain open.
This panel aims to bring together a broad set of papers that explore the relationship between local electoral institutions and political representation, largely focusing on racial and ethnic inequalities.

Covering texts from the ancient Greeks to the present day, the panel highlights the odd prominence of tragic and comedic self-questioning in works of dramatic art. What happens when tragedy and comedy examine themselves, or when they interrogate their supposed opposites? The papers on this panel contend that tragedy and comedy are not merely literary genres but offer distinctive and comprehensive answers to basic questions of political philosophy about justice, nature, and law.
This panel will attend to the broader significance of comedy and tragedy—political, philosophical, and religious—and how the the poets diverge from familiar theoretical formulations of comedy and tragedy found in Plato, Aristotle, Hegel, and Nietzsche. As the APSA 2022 theme invites us to “Rethink, Restructure, and Reconnect,” this panel will help to rethink and restructure the canon of political theory by showing how tragedy and comedy engage with its questions. As we begin to “reconnect” as scholars and as a community, this panel invites us to consider the theatre as the locus classicus of communal reflection—and self-reflection—about political life.
Paper Abstracts:
Matt Dinan, “The Bad End Unhappily, The Good Unluckily: Tom Stoppard on Comedy and Freedom”
Tom Stoppard’s Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead is a comedic adaptation of Shakespeare’s Hamlet. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead pulses with tragic necessity: its conclusion is announced in its title. Despite the inevitable horizon of death—Rosencrantz and Guildenstern’s and ours—Stoppard creates a comedy; more, a comedy about tragedy. While many critics consider R&G a work nihilistic absurdism, this paper argues that Stoppard upholds comedic art as an alternative to the grounds for a tragic view of life as articulated in Shakespeare’s Hamlet in the inability to achieve stable knowledge about nature, the inscrutability of divine providence, and the viciousness of human beings.
Derek Duplessie, “The Tragedy of Dionysius in Euripides’ Bacchae”
This paper will attempt to tease out a poetic rejoinder to the Socratic critique of poetry in the Republic by looking at Euripides’ Bacchae, a play which is of special relevance insofar as its hero is Dionysus, the god of tragic theatre. Through undertaking a reading of the Bacchae as a meta-poem—a tragedy about tragedy and its fraught relation to the polis—I will consider how and whether the Euripidean understanding differs from the Platonic/Socratic view.
Andrew Moore, “Marlowe’s Faustus and the Natural Order”
Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus is, formally speaking, a tragedy; indeed it is a terrible and terrifying tragedy: a world famous sorcerer (and scholar) suffers eternal damnation for his prideful pursuit of knowledge. However, the play is also filled with practical jokes, biting satire, and clownish characters. Throughout the play Marlowe explores the boundary between humour and horror. Faustus himself is a transgressive figure who makes a deal with the devil. But Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus is also a play intensely interested in the moral order of the universe and its durability in the face of human transgression. Faustus acquires extraordinary supernatural power and yet he spends his time on petty ambitions and parlour tricks. How powerful, then, is Faustus? Why does Faustus, who seems to have the power to subvert and evade the laws of nature, still suffer the natural consequences of his grasping, overreaching ambition? What might this tell us about the natural order and natural law?
Mary Townsend, “Hints, Pretexts, and Denouement: Tragic Foretelling in Thucydides’ A History of the Peloponnesian War”
In Thucydides’ Melian Dialogue, the Athenians try and fail to express the whole truth of their project to the city they intend if necessary to destroy. The Athenians state that the overwhelming force they possess has only one narrative outcome, but the Melians refuse to accept their logic, and their city falls, just as the Athenians predict. This narrative pattern has its roots in the Sophoclean logic of the exemplary tragedy, Oedipus Rex, where the prophecy that insists Oedipus will kill his father and marry his mother fails to avert the predicted disaster, just as anticipated. In classical tragedy, the inevitable provides aesthetic satisfaction. But in politics, this aesthetic is not enough, since dreadful outcomes ought to be resisted. On these grounds, the attempt of the Athenians has a certain nobility to it, despite its failures. But as Jane Austen points out, “seldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human endeavor;” and in fact, direct attempts at disclosure have tragic outcomes. Perhaps, as seen in the logic of comedic disclosure, especially the romantic disclosure of Austen, plain speaking is only possible when laughter can accompany it; but if this is so, is the seriousness of politics a necessary recipe for disaster?",Mary E.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 49: Canadian Politics,,September 17,am,10:00,11:30,Canadian Foreign Policy in a Disorderly World,"Canada faces a daunting set of domestic and international challenges that will deeply impact the course of its foreign policy. Some are immediate and pressing, such as recovering from the pandemic, and others are at the top of the political agenda, such as climate change. But many more are seemingly under the radar. These include the democratic backsliding around the world, and most troublingly, among established liberal democracies; a growingly aging and ethnically diverse Canadian society, giving rise to so-called ‘diaspora politicking’; as well as a rising number of civil wars challenging a key Canadian foreign policy priority, namely UN peace operations. Facing multiple challenges pulling Canada in different directions, the decade ahead may turn out to be one of the most difficult for a cohesive Canadian foreign policy. As Canada is currently crafting a strategy for the Indo-Pacific and has yet to update its last national security strategy published 18 years ago, it is necessary to better understand how best Canada can address these challenges. This panel offers analyses of four issues that are expected to shape Canadian foreign policy in the 2020s, namely: the influence of diasporas on foreign policy, the future of Canadian participation in peace operations, the state of civil-military relations, and the strategy discourse in Canadian foreign and defense policy thinking.",Justin Massie UQAM,Christopher Michael Sands Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars,"Size Matters: The Influence of Diasporas on Canadian Foreign Aid Allocation - Jean-Christophe Boucher, University of Calgary; Justin Massie, UQAM

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 52: Migration & Citizenship,,September 17,am,10:00,11:30,Governing Refugee Return,"Increased cross-border displacement since 2015 has been met with widespread calls to restrict migration and return refugees. This issue has taken center stage as conflict dynamics in Syria have shifted and states hosting Syrian refugees have sought to orchestrate refugees’ return. Turkey, for example, has used military incursions to attempt to create so-called ‘safe zones’ to return refugees to Syria. The European Union has also stepped-up calls for refugee return, placing swift and sustainable returns at the center of the EU’s legislative policy agenda. Though the issue has gained in policy salience, there remains a paucity of research in comparative politics or international relations on the governance of refugee return. How do local, national, and international actors with diverging interests engage with return processes? What geopolitical interests shape these push and pull dynamics? How do governance outcomes align with refugees’ preferences and affect refugee rights? This panel addresses these questions through both theoretic and empirical contributions, drawing on examples across a range of contexts including the Middle East, East Africa and Latin America to further our understanding of refugee return governance. Bidwas and Mencütek use case studies of Turkey’s military incursions into Syria in 2017-18 and India’s war against Pakistan in 1971 to explore the conditions under which refugee hosting states resort to strategic coercive actions against refugee sending states. Using extensive archival material, Bradley examines how refugees themselves influenced the governance of return from Honduras to El Salvador in the 1980s by serving as norm entrepreneurs. Fakhoury and Stel examine how the EU cooperates with refugee-hosting states beyond the EU’s borders in its ‘Southern Neighbourhood’ to uphold conditions for voluntary, safe, and dignified returns. Finally, Schwartz’s paper identifies ‘return without refoulement’ as a common but understudied strategy states use to return recognized refugees already on their territory while arguably upholding international principles of refugee protection. Combined, these papers provide much needed conceptual and empirical grounding for the study of governing refugee return, and further broader debates within political science on international norms, strategic displacement, and humanitarian institutions.",Lama Mourad Carleton University,Jay Ramasubramanyam York University,"Realizing the Right of Return - Megan Bradley, McGill University

Of the various texts being read with new purpose, from Defoe's ""A Journal of the Plague Year"" to Marquez's ""Love in the Time of Cholera,"" Albert Camus' ""Plague"" has proven itself most relevant to our present circumstances. This panel's three presenters will examine different aspects of ""The Plague"" from their shared appreciation of the novel as a work of political philosophy for our time. Matt Sharpe will compare Camus' work with accounts given by Thucydides and Lucretius of plagues as natural and political phenomena. Zdravko Planinc will present a literary-critical analysis focusing on the significance of Gluck’s ""Orphée et Eurydice"" in the novel.

Related Groups / Asian Pacific American Caucus",September 17,am,10:00,11:30,"Race, Identity, and the Determinants of Asian American Political Behavior","Asian Americans, the fastest-growing racial group in the US, are exerting a growing influence on American politics, urging scholars to examine their political behavior. In addition, the dramatic rise in anti-Asian hate amidst the COVID-19 pandemic calls for renewed attention to deep-seated anti-Asian racism and its long-term political consequences. This panel brings together scholars whose works explore the factors that shape Asian American political behavior, ethno-racial identities, and the political implications of growing anti-Asian sentiment in the United States. In her paper, Tanika Raychaudhuri analyzes the process of political learning among Asian Americans, experimentally testing whether Asian Americans develop partisan views through political endorsements from peer networks. Jennifer Wu empirically assesses the implications of local demographics for pan-Asian racial identity and the downstream consequences of racial identification for political behavior. In their co-authored paper, Jae Yeon Kim, Joan Cho, and D.G. Kim explore the political underpinnings of pan-Asian racial identity, testing whether Asian Americans' views toward home country politics and shared marginalized status influence feelings of group consciousness. Finally, Nathan Kar Ming Chan and Vivien Leung explore the political consequences of growing anti-Asian sentiments amid the COVID-19 pandemic, assessing the role of the racial attitudes in shaping Americans’ vote choices between 2008 and 2020. These papers draw on a varied range of theoretical perspectives, empirical data, and methods to explore questions at the intersection of racial identification, anti-Asian sentiment, and Asian American political behavior.

Or Must Democracy Do without One?,"Democratic theory has long envisioned the need for a society of well-informed citizens who make thoughtful decisions about the policies and candidates they support. Is this just a utopian ideal, hardly to be taken seriously, given what we know about actual voters and their behavior? If the aspiration is utopian, can viable democratic processes make do with the citizens we actually have? One approach is to harness new technologies to stimulate the scaling of mass deliberation via structured discussion or via non-interactive voting aids. Another approach is to use deliberative microcosms of the public to make recommendations to policy makers as well as to the broader public. However, some scholars question this approach as an unacceptable “second best.” The papers by Fishkin et al and by Gastil explore new technologies to scale deliberation. The paper by Hansen presents a unique institutionalization of deliberative mini-publics in Denmark to advise the Parliament on actual policy making. The paper by Lafont attacks the whole idea of a deliberative mini-public as an unacceptable second best.",Jane Mansbridge Harvard Kennedy School,"Christopher F. Karpowitz Brigham Young University

By studying state repression in historical as well as contemporary contexts, the four research projects provide new theoretical insights and empirical evidence into the scholarship of repression and conflict processes.
The first project studies the role of information and trust in explaining the motivation of ethnic-based repression under foreign threats, using the context of the Chinese Cultural Revolution to empirically test this theory. The second project investigates the suppressive effect of surveillance technology on protest in autocracies using original street maps and social media data from China. The third research examines the role of religious leaders in democratic transitions by focusing on their persuasive influence in human rights trials. The authors address this puzzle in the context of Argentina, where Catholic leaders engaged in the prosecution of human rights violations during the country’s Dirty War. The fourth project applies text analysis methods to explore the substitution between civilian courts and military tribunals in Francoist Spain and assesses how courts can serve as repressive instruments in authoritarian regimes.
Together, the four research projects enrich the theoretical and empirical knowledge of the causes and consequences of state repression by introducing novel conceptual frameworks, data collection, measurement strategies, and empirical evidence to analyze and predict the threats of human rights violations.","Courtenay R.

Virtual Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 15: European Politics and Society,,September 17,am,10:00,11:30,Negative Campaigning in Europe (Virtual Session),"Political parties spend parts of their campaigns criticizing other parties’ issue positions, performance, and characteristics, such as honesty, integrity, unity. While negative campaigning has been common in the U.S. elections, political parties also engage in negative campaigning across European countries. Yet, compared to an extensive U.S. literature examining why parties go negative, only a handful of comparative studies examine negative campaigning in Europe, most of which focus on a single country case or a small number of countries. In this panel, the authors unpack European parties’ negative campaigning and ask important questions like how issue ownership and incumbency status affect negative campaigning (Weitzel), whether political parties attack others more on issue positions or valence characteristics (Pereira) or on issues that the other parties own (Baczynska), and how the journalists double the negativity through their reporting of negative campaigns (Bene and Farkas). Using an original dataset, the Comparative Campaign Dynamics dataset, that covers the three to five most recent elections in ten European democracies and reports how political parties discuss their own issue positions and valence characteristics as well as discuss each other, the authors provide the most thorough analysis of negative campaigning across Europe. The findings of this panel have important implications for the comparative political communication and political parties’ literatures.",Zeynep Somer-Topcu University of Texas at Austin,"James Adams University of California, Davis

Leng and Plantan’s paper grapples with censorship in Chinese academia by analyzing the experiences of Chinese academics with political control, and how it shapes their intellectual agenda and publication records. Manning’s paper explores the practices of control over female reproductive rights by examining how female village heads enforced the one-child policy through “relational repression.” Farid and Li’s paper engages with transnational repression by studying political control of international NGOs operating in China. Luo, Stockmann and Landry’s paper tackles the implementation of China’s Social Credit System, and how this form of surveillance shapes public trust in the government. Beyond illuminating the operations of control, these papers also reveal new modes of resistance, including how Chinese academics bypass censorship by publishing in English and how INGOs embrace legal registration and localization tactics to continue operating in China. Some papers, like that by Luo, Stockman and Landry, also complicate our understanding of the consequences of repression, as they find that trust in government increases with more widespread surveillance that’s perceived to be of public benefit.",Lynette H.

First, Joseph Brown asks whether the current wave of anti-pipeline direct action protests in the U.S. and Canada represent a cohesive transnational movement or are simply separate community uprisings. In examining possible links between different protests, Brown focuses especially on fault lines between white and indigenous activists. Next, John Hultgren interviews environmental justice activists from conservative rural parts of the U.S. and argues that a Polanyian eco-socialism might engender political mobilization and transformation in conservative rural areas. Then, Andy Scerri turns to the democratic republican tradition to argue that the power of wealthy elites needs to be answered not just with positive contestation but also with negative obstruction designed to ensure the participation of all in the formulation of laws and procedures that restrain the most powerful from benefiting from fossil fuels with impunity. Finally, Jason Maloy reconsiders the debate over 1970s survivalism and the “terrible trio” of Hardin, Heilbroner, and Ophuls. Maloy argues that, while the debate largely ended by the 1990s, a reconsideration of the survivalist argument for green oligarchy is necessary for those who seek a democratic green politics for the climate crisis.",Mary Witlacil Colorado State Univeristy,Chelsea Welker University of Northern Colorado,"Great Transformation in Trump Country?

Charnysh and Piqué explore the effects of Nazi repression in Poland, leveraging variation in institutional landscapes in the different occupation zones. They find that heterogeneity in repression practices had major impact on voter behavior, religiosity, and population structures. Projects by Balcells & Villamil and Barceló and Peisakhin problematize the assumption that exposure to violence leads directly to a predictable shift in behavior. Balcells and Villamil explore the complex interplay between historical violence and media coverage and the resultant political polarization. Barceló and Peisakhin show how historical memory is often shaped by political entrepreneurs and not by actual experience of violence. Wittenberg provides a conceptual overview of how social scientists think about persistence and change and stresses that some change is identity-destroying and other identity-preserving.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 12: Comparative Politics of Developing Countries,,September 17,pm,2:00,3:30,Addressing Ethnic Inequality: Experiences of Reform,"Inequality and exclusion, which have persisted and deepened even amidst economic growth in many contexts, are core global challenges. This panel, which presents selected papers from a broader research initiative, focuses on inequalities between groups in society defined in “ethnic” terms broadly conceived. A growing literature speaks to the significance of such ethnic (“group-based,” “horizontal”) inequalities across diverse dimensions of ascriptive cleavage – for instance, race in South Africa, indigenous status in Mexico, or caste in India (see, e.g., Alesina, Michalopoulos, & Papaioannou, 2016; Baldwin & Huber, 2010; Brown & Langer, 2010; Canelas & Gisselquist, 2018; Cederman, Weidmann, & Gleditsch, 2011; Østby, 2008; Stewart, 2002, 2008; United Nations & World Bank, 2018).
This research initiative addresses the politics of government policies aimed at lessening, or mediating the harms of, such ethnic inequalities. Standard policies to address such inequalities include affirmative action, anti-discriminatory legislation, social protection schemes, and efforts to close gaps in access to public services (UNDP, 2013).
In recent years, broad international consensus around the importance of addressing inequality has attracted considerable research and policy attention. This is underscored in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially the core principle of “leave no one behind” and SDG 10: Reducing Inequality. A rich body of related research speaks to the impact of various policies, offering lessons about which policies are most effective and worth expanding or adopting elsewhere (see, e.g., Abdullah, Doucouliagos, & Manning, 2015; Gulzar, Haas, & Pasquale, 2020; Jorda & Alonso, 2020; Owusu-Addo, Renzaho, & Smith, 2018; Ravallion, 2020). Considerably less attention has been paid to how particular policies come about (rather than others) and are sustained (or not) in different contexts.
This research initiative speaks to this gap, with attention to politics, policy making, and policy implementation. It asks: Why was a particular policy pursed, rather than alternatives? Why was it pursued in one period rather than another? Who were the key champions and opponents? How did the political will for addressing ethnic inequalities – and doing so in this way, rather than another – come about? What other institutions, individuals, and factors played a key role in shaping implementation? What were the major obstacles? How were efforts sustained (or not)?
Core to this initiative is a set of detailed case study chapters. Selected to cover a range of policies and contexts in the Global South, these case study chapters collectively provide a picture of the politics of addressing ethnic inequalities in low- to middle-income countries that offers both breadth and depth.
The proposed panel includes three of the case chapters along with the introductory/framing chapter. While policy discussion often focuses on affirmative action and other group-targeted approaches to addressing ethnic inequalities, the introductory/framing paper makes a case for considering a wider range of policy approaches, in particular a range from explicitly ethnic group-targeted to more universally framed approaches (Horowitz, 1985; Samman, Roche, Sarwar, & Evans, 2021; Weiner, 1983). The collection as a whole then brings together studies of both of key group-targeted policies (such as Reservations in India, Malaysia’s New Economic Policy, and South Africa’s Black Economic Empowerment) and other, more diverse policies influencing ethnic inequality.
The three case chapters presented as part of this panel provide illustration of the latter in particular. The two papers by Natasha Sugiyama and Rotimi Suberu explore different cases where policies with clear influence on ethnic inequality do not explicitly target marginalized groups in ethnic terms. At one end of the spectrum, Sugiyama’s paper considers the politics of Bolsa Familia in Brazil, a program with clear impact on marginalized groups that is not framed in ethnic terms. Rotimi Suberu considers the federal character principle in Nigeria, which is framed in regional rather than explicitly ethnic terms. The third paper, by Neil DeVotta, deals with educational “standardization” in Sri Lanka, a policy that on the surface looks like affirmative action elsewhere but functions quite differently given that the target group is politically dominant (if economically disadvantaged historically). Finally, the paper by Rachel Gisselquist, editor of the collection, provides a broader view on the project and its eight core case studies, how the three studies in this panel are situated within, and the comparative findings that emerge from a collective reading of all eight cases.
Simone Schotte, as discussant, will draw on her ongoing research on affirmative action around the world to provide comments on the four papers.",Rachel M.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 12: Comparative Politics of Developing Countries,,September 17,pm,2:00,3:30,The Politics of Social Transformation in India,"Over the past thirty years, Indian politics and society have undergone rapid transformations. Market-oriented reforms, rising incomes, mass urban migration, widespread industrialization, the rise of a new hegemonic party, and massive increases in representation of historically marginalized groups have transformed the nature of Indian democracy. As incomes have risen and diversified, population density has shifted from the rural periphery to growing urban centers, and technology has transformed the economy and communication, parties have adjusted their strategies to target newly empowered voters, and the contours of citizenship have been redefined.
This panel brings together a key chapter from each of four book manuscripts that explore the politics of social transformation in India and advance our understanding of the new politics these changes have wrought. The panel explores the impact that technology, education, trade, and gender have on Indian politics and society today. In combination, they paint a picture of a changing landscape of political participation, political representation, and public policy. In line with the 2022 conference theme, the four manuscripts encourage us to rethink the nature of political representation in India and how large-scale structural transformations have and continue to impact political and economic equality in the world’s largest democracy.
Dasgupta’s evaluates how technological change has disrupted the distribution of political power in Indian society. He shows how one of the major technological revolutions of the twentieth century -- the introduction of new crop technologies during the green revolution -- resulted in the decline of single-party dominance and the transition to a multi-party competitive political system, as the winners from this technological revolution mobilized in agrarian opposition parties. Dasgupta's book manuscript highlights the central role that exposure to technological change plays in generating factor endowment-based political conflict and changes in political equilibria, including democratization under certain circumstances. Beyond a long-run determinant of economic growth, Dasgupta shows that technological change also reconfigure political power in society.
Davies’s book manuscript considers the considerable changes in India's public service regime over the past 40 years. Since the early 1980s, India has rapidly expanded access to services such as health and education. At the same time, Indian citizens have exited government services for private providers. What impact has this exit had on political accountability and participation? In this book manuscript, Davies shows that the growth of publicly provided services and exit to private services has increased segregation between ethnic groups, reshaped the relationship between citizens, particularly lower caste citizens, and the Indian state, with particularly strong implications for state legitimacy and public service provision. Using a variety of methods, including original field surveys and downstream experiments, archival methods, and the creation of a new dataset of the expansion of private schools, Davies brings new data to a fundamental question in political science: how does state service provision shape the relationship between citizens and the state?
In Gaikwad’s book manuscript, politics is transformed by the ethnic composition of the electorate. Gaikwad provides a new theory for how politicians leverage economic policy in diverse settings. Contrary to common expectation, he demonstrates that minority groups more often dictate the nature of economic policy appeals as majority groups can be more easily mobilized on identity-based appeals. Drawing on evidence largely from India, this project evaluates this theory and shows how the distribution of identity in one of the most diverse countries of the world fundamentally shape the nature of economic policy-making.
Prillaman’s book seeks to understand when politics in is transformed to yield greater representation of women. In India women vote at rates near equal to those of men but participate in between election substantially less. She suggests that this puzzle is best understood as the consequence of a patriarchal political order, where women often lack political agency and political authority. As a result, women’s political participation is a function of not only their own resources and incentives but of the incentives of those with power over their political decisions, namely their male family members, and these patterns of political behavior underly and uphold a larger political order and structure of governance. Yet such a political order can be transformed when women have access to networks that allow them to demand their political agency. Drawing on large-scale quantitative and qualitative data and two natural experiments, Prillaman sheds light on the relational roots of gender inequalities in political participation.",Prerna Singh Brown University,"Prerna Singh Brown University

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 16: International Political Economy,,September 17,pm,2:00,3:30,The Contemporary Politics of Foreign Aid,"The research in this panel examines the contemporary politics of foreign aid. The rise of emerging economies and increasing diversity among foreign aid donors, as well as changes in the design of foreign aid programs, have prompted new questions about the accountability of donors and recipient governments, power relations between donors and recipients, and the effectiveness of aid. The four papers in this panel consider understudied dimensions of aid donor motivations and the responses to foreign aid in recipient countries. Examining the policy of aid targeting, Briggs argues that even ostensibly universal aid programs involve spatial targeting, raising questions about the influence of poverty and politics on where local public goods are provided. Allen et al. also analyze donors’ aid allocation decisions, drawing attention to the neglected role of state capacity in donors’ decision to bypass recipient governments and instead channel aid through non-state actors. The other two papers in this panel consider responses to foreign aid in recipient countries. Examining the views of policymakers, Blair et al. use data from a conjoint survey experiment fielded to policymakers in low- and middle-income countries to explain what makes foreign aid from some donors more attractive than others. Finally, Clark et al. study public opinion toward aid conditionality in recipient countries, testing when individuals are more likely to see aid conditions as a source of accountability or a sovereignty infringement.",Desh Girod Georgetown University,"Desh Girod Georgetown University

This panel investigates the origins and consequences of rebels' and revolutionaries' efforts to transform societies in several ways. Kaplan and Mampilly’s paper presents a new concept of radical rebel diplomacy, to mean: rebel networking efforts that fall outside of traditional diplomatic channels. Rooted in leftist internationalism and other identarian forms, the legacies of these radical networks are not an abatement of conflict, but political and military support for insurgencies around the world. Reyes, Zaks, and Albert similarly consider the legacies of rebels’ transformative judicial systems. They argue that wartime judiciary as a rebel group became a post-war legacy and served as the basis for the subsequent legal system. Mukherjee similarly explores the legacies of Maoist revolutionary rebels in India. Specifically, he argues that pressure from Maoist insurgents expedited land reform and state-building in Andhra Pradesh. Finally, Stewart explores the legacies of failed and abandoned revolutionary programs. Using the case of the Republican Calendar in France, Stewart argues that where these programs were more rigorously implemented, people are more likely to engage in later collective action consistent with the program's original ambitions.",Shivaji Mukherjee University of Toronto,"Devorah S.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 44: Democracy and Autocracy,,September 17,pm,2:00,3:30,Why Promote Democracy?,"Recent years have seen a flourishing of critical research on democracy promotion. While the 1990s were the heyday of enthusiasm for democracy promotion, over the past decade scholars have suggested that democracy promotion often does not foster democratization and in fact can have inadvertent and harmful consequences. The recent resurgence of authoritarianism has further pushed scholars to rethink the utility and purpose of democracy promotion. As such, our panel pairs broad theoretical questions about democracy promotion with careful empirical study. Why promote democracy? How should such programs be designed? What drives the practices of democracy promotion? Under what conditions does it begin, change, or end? How do citizens in recipient countries perceive foreign aid from democracies, in comparison to autocracies? The papers on this panel tackle these pressing questions through rich, innovative analysis and diverse methodologies to illuminate the most pressing challenges and neglected dimensions of democracy promotion today.
Jeremy Menchik’s paper compares democracy promotion with another project of ideological encompassment: the mainline Protestant missionary project. Drawing on comparative historical analysis and 40 original interviews with mainline Protestant missionaries and democracy advocates, the paper suggests that the two projects share similar structural origins, aspirations, practices and evolutions. The comparison further hints at the future of democracy promotion. Erin Snider’s paper explores why particular ideas about democracy prevail in democracy aid provision and how institutional changes to the administration of democracy aid over time have privileged donor interests rather than those of local recipients. Drawing on extensive fieldwork in Egypt and novel, new data from a professional networking site that captures the movement of over 2,000 professionals working in the field of democracy aid, the paper illuminates our understanding of the constraints, incentives, and practices of the actors engaged at both the recipient and donor ends of such aid. Tsveta Petrova and Paulina Pospieszna explore a pressing question: what happens to democracy promotion during periods of democratic rollback? Against the common wisdom that the two processes move in parallel, they find that Polish democracy promotion efforts continue even amid rollback due to the embeddedness of democracy promotion in foreign and security policy. That said, they also find that the substance of democracy promotion has changed, from supporting civil and political society abroad toward programs that are closer to the new conservative values promoted at home. Using an original survey experiment, Adea Gafuri and Agnes Cornell investigate public opinion about foreign assistance by disentangling the effects of regime type, transparency and non-transparency in aid implementation, and historical success or failure of aid programs on citizens’ attitudes in the recipient country. In an age of both democracy promotion and authoritarianism promotion, their research deepens our understanding of the circumstances in which citizens in recipient countries will accept autocratic donors’ practices.
Together, the papers open the black box of democracy aid to uncover how democracy assistance is imagined, constrained, adapted, and perceived on the ground. At a time when the liberal world order is under increasing strain, the authors are collectively rethinking the power and practices of democracy promotion.",Inken von Borzyskowski University College London (UCL),Dan Slater University of Michigan,"Do Donor Practices Matter to Citizens in Recipient Countries? - Adea Gafuri, University of Gothenburg; Agnes Cornell, University of Gothenburg

While the causes and consequences of the polarization has not been fully appreciated, the COVID-19 pandemic has added a new twist to this trend. While political differences had been briefly suppressed in an effort to overcome a national health threat, after 2 years of the pandemic, the Korean politics now witnesses a new feature of polarization especially with the 20th presidential election ahead. In this respect, this session revisits the overall trend of partisan and ideological polarization in Korean politics, and investigates how the pandemic has changed the nature and characteristics of polarized and contentious politics in Korea.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Related Groups / Disasters and Crises Related Group,,September 17,pm,2:00,3:30,The Politics of Disaster Response: COVID-19 and Beyond,"After a disaster, governments and non-state actors are tasked with assisting populations and rebuilding affected areas. The way in which they do so is not always effective. Yet, why some post-disaster responses are more successful than others, and what the role of government policy is, is still poorly understood. Therefore, this panel addresses the effects of policy choices in response to disasters, ranging from declaring a disaster an emergency, to investing in infrastructure, cooperating with international organizations, and influencing vaccine uptake.
In the first paper, Allison Grossman explores the effect disaster affected countries’ government’s policy has on funds donated to respond to the emergency. She finds that governments are more likely to classify a disaster as an emergency in the case of rapid onset disasters, while they are less likely to do so for slow onset disasters. Further, she demonstrates that international donors are more likely to assist governments in their disaster response when the disaster has been classified as an emergency. In the second paper, Daniel Aldrich explores the consequences of governments investing the vast majority of resources dedicated to rebuilding post-disaster in gray infrastructures such as dams and seawalls, rather than in social infrastructure such as parks and public schools. He demonstrates the effects of such uneven investment on outcomes such as suicide, migration and crime rates. In the third paper, Valerie de Koeijer focuses on the effects of post-disaster response on gender equality. She builds on research showing that women are often overrepresented among those worst affected by disaster. She finds that relationships between governments and international organizations influence gender inequality via three factors: government restrictions, state-international organization integration, and international organizations’ understanding of the local context. In the fourth and final paper, Liz Shanahan and colleagues zoom in on individuals’ behavior. They look at the effect of narrative and non-narrative messages on US citizens’ intention to get the COVID-19 vaccine. They aim to understand how visual narrativity can help reduce the risk of COVID-19, and ultimately how it can help to reduce vaccine refusal and hesitancy.
Together, these papers contribute to the growing literature on the politics of disaster, and each have policy implications for government officials and beyond. While a lot of the disaster literature has focused on the pandemic response, this panel brings research on the COVID-19 response together with research on other disasters, for instance extreme weather events such as hurricanes, and flooding. The geographical focus of the papers in this panel is also varied, including the United States, Japan, and Dominica. This approach encourages conversations across various types of disaster responses around the world, to see whether lessons learned in disaster response in one type and/or geographical location can apply to others.",Thomas A.

Afterall, K-12 education is premised on revealing one’s thoughts, expressions, and feelings to peers and teachers in classrooms, yet the pandemic demands masking and social distancing. Where were K-12 achievement outcomes trending prior to the onset of the pandemic? What effects have various virus mitigation policies had on student socio-emotional outcomes in different types of schools? During the pandemic, enrollments rose in various schools of choice, including religiously conservative private schools. What effects do such schools have on key civic outcomes, relative to schooling in government-run public schools? More generally, are private school choice programs and private schooling threats to or instruments of the conveyance of democratic values to citizens in the U.S. and globally? These are the vital questions examined by these papers. Paper 1 applies a principal-agent perspective to a fresh examination of changes in K-12 student achievement over the past 50 years. It reveals that achievement has grown steadily over the half-century, a “Flynn effect,” with growth varying in interesting ways by educational domain, age, ability level, race, and SES level. These patterns are similar for the U.S. and internationally, suggesting that universal underlying causes are driving them. Paper 2 focuses on the pandemic and its effects on student socio-emotional outcomes. Drawing from national survey data, it examines variance in parental perceptions of the socio-emotional condition of their school-age children based on school factors such as instruction modality, schooling sector, stage of the pandemic, seriousness of community spread, and partisanship of the region. Paper 3 examines concerns surrounding conservative Protestant schools fostering various forms of intolerance. Drawing on fresh survey data, it finds that students educated in conservative Protestant schools demonstrate average intolerance levels that are statistically equivalent to their public-school peers. Finally, Paper 4 examines the perennial concern of the effects of private schooling on civic outcomes more generally. It uses meta-analytic techniques to identify and consolidate the empirical findings from the population of studies on private schooling and a wide range of civic outcomes involving tolerance, political participation, civic knowledge and skills, and community involvement. Collectively, these four papers will tell us much about the challenges faced in K-12 education and the prospects for public policies to improve achievement, socio-emotional, and civic outcomes of the next generation of citizens. The panel Chair and discussants will provide insights based on a wealth of experience in the field, in the case of senior scholars Jennifer Hochschild and David Campbell, and a fresh view, in the case of junior scholar Ursula Hackett.",Leah A.

Using a Eurasian anchor, with detailed studies from Russia and China, the panel incorporates perspectives on ‘the rentier state’ from both Latin America and the Middle East/North Africa regions. By doing so, the participants show that simplistic hypotheses about rents and what political economies they produce are challenged by more current empirical evidence.
Strokan argues that rather than material or even historical determinism, natural resources have been handled quite differently across the post-Soviet space. Hong and Yang find that socially disadvantaged groups may not reap the benefits of natural resources, and that the resources itself may determine the social welfare impacts in China. Zadorian finds that Russia and Brazil failed to follow predictions laid out in classic rentier state theory following their commodity booms, complicating our expectations of countries newly flush with resource rents. Finally, Evans and Hartshorn seek to disentangle which of the overlapping political economic structures endemic to both the MENA and post-Soviet regions can be attributed to rents, resources, or institutional legacies. Together these papers point to new directions in comparative political economy and development, and serve as a starting point for more robust conversations across regional expertise.","Allison D.

Four of the papers illustrate the different ways in which the Chinese party-state attempts to accomplish its international objectives, ranging from coercion to norm diffusion and development aid. Zhang, Shanks and Liu’s paper examines China’s increasing use of economic coercion in mitigating international tensions, finding that this tactic has had limited success in extracting concessions, and ends up hurting the Chinese economy. Luo’s paper analyzes the variation in China’s dispute escalation strategies, including military and non-military tactics through the case-studies of South China Sea disputes. Seiwert’s study examines China’s norm-making in international security through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and Chen’s paper analyzes the opportunities and limitations of state-driven development aid in Africa. Finally, Yinan’s paper shifts into the domestic realm by exploring how external “othering” has been mobilized in facilitating nationalism and regime support. Beyond the timely topics and analysis, these papers illuminate diverse methodologies for analyzing China’s global footprint and its implications for domestic politics.",Meg E.

Snegovaya and Petrova focus on the democratic attitudes and behavior of supporters of right-wing populism in Poland and Hungary as they use an experimental research design to infer the willingness of populist voters to trade off among democracy’s different dimensions. Gessler and Wunsch pose a related question and ask, specifically, what drives citizens in consolidated democracies to endorse leaders who advocate a program of democratic erosion. Their analysis looks at the trade-offs between the preservation of democratic procedures and other types of economic and cultural benefits. Marina Popescu and Gabor Toka address the question of democratic backsliding from a supply-side perspective. They use major cross-national surveys to examine whether the rise of electoral authoritarianism in the region may be attributed to disenchantment with democracy that results from the failure of weak political parties to establish meaningful programmatic party-voter linkages. Hubert Tworzecki also considers political parties in his analysis but, based on the case of Poland, focuses instead on the ability of populist radical right parties to construct electoral coalitions. Finally, Petrova and Ganga address the consequences of populists’ time in office as they study their seeming immunity to the proliferation of political scandals that they vowed to stop.",Paula Daniela Ganga Columbia University,"Barbara Geddes University of California, Los Angeles

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 1: Political Thought and Philosophy,,September 17,pm,4:00,5:30,Rousseau as Reader and Reading Rousseau: New Perspectives,"This is a panel on Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s reading of ancient authors and on modern authors who read Rousseau after the Revolution. The papers are united in trying to grasp how Rousseau and his readers addressed the imperfect foundations of modern economics, morality, and politics, which imperfections haunt us today.
The panel begins with Rousseau’s idiosyncratic relationship to the Greeks: not just his Discourse on Inequality, our first paper argues, but his Social Contract and his mature judgment on the proper relationship between economics and freedom owes much more than has often been thought to Greek authors, especially Plato and Plato’s later devotee, Plutarch. This connects to our second paper, on Karl Polanyi, that idiosyncratic sociologist and economic historian who, the paper claims, adopted a Rousseauian critique of modern society while at the same time siding with Aristotle on the pivotal issue of humankind’s natural sociability.
Three other authors who tried to modify Rousseau—to accept what they could without ending up where he did, at thoughts that became synonymous with the Revolution’s wild hopes and wilder, continent-breaking outcomes—anchor our second and third papers. The first of these authors is Judith Shklar, whose moral psychology comes closer to a morality of pity that is normally acknowledged. The second and third are François Guizot and Alexis de Tocqueville, each of whom looked to Rousseau to better understand the oncoming democratic age.
On economics, psychology, and democratic politics Rousseau’s thought stretched far into the past and has since stretched far into the future; following this year’s theme, this panel aims to rethink and restore the lineage and the legacy of one of the most important writers in the history of political thought.",Dennis C.

This panel explores the politics of the energy transition by bringing together fresh comparative and international research on oil security, transnational environmental agreements, and the mining of lithium, a crucial mineral required to store energy from renewable sources. At the international level, the shift away from fossil-based fuels has posed new challenges for political leaders as they strive to negotiate international environmental agreements that are both effective and sustainable. Moreover, the energy transition has destabilized longstanding geopolitical alliances anchored in “oil for security” deals linking petrostates with superpower protectors. Inside countries that are rich in lithium, the critical non-renewable resource that makes renewable energy possible, the energy transition has unleashed contentious processes of bargaining among mining companies, local communities, and national and subnational governments over the terms of lithium extraction. Together, the papers offer new insights about the domestic and international political challenges posed by climate change and the global imperative of shifting to renewable energy sources.",Richard O.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 11: Comparative Politics,,September 17,pm,4:00,5:30,Violent Actors and Threats to Local Democracy,"The panel brings together diverse perspectives on the local implications of violence across the developing world. Violent actors can influence political parties, community associations, and even the outcome of elections, complicating democratic consolidation. This is especially true at the local level, where violent actors may have more leverage over local power brokers and be able to forge politically decisive partnerships. This panel interrogates how a range of violent actors shape local political outcomes by analyzing studies of four major emerging democracies: Brazil, India, Mexico, and the Philippines.
Each of the four papers in this panel addresses a distinct aspect of the intersection between violence and local politics. The first two papers explore the complicated relationship between armed group presence and democratic consolidation. Chriswell provides a theoretical framework explaining how civil society organizes to deal with armed group presence and subsequent insecurity, explaining why citizens organize either through or around the state. She contends that the strength of pre-existing civil society, degree of criminal competition, and level of state autonomy explain where and how groups of citizens contest criminal group presence, and tests this in the Mexican case. Haim then explains why local political clans have incentives to make alliances with insurgents in the Philippines, despite national counterinsurgency policies. His analysis demonstrates the key role that local political elites play in determining counterinsurgency success and in managing violence. The next two papers focus on how armed group presence can shape actors and their decisions during election cycles. Stommes explores when armed political parties use violence against their rivals during the election cycle. He demonstrates how incumbent electoral losses shape the subsequent targets and timing of violence in West Bengal, India. Trudeau argues that candidates most likely to strike electoral deals with criminal groups are those that leverage their dissimilarities, both from the criminal group and the constituents. Drawing from local races in Brazil, she shows how candidates minimize legal and physical risk in order to benefit from criminal involvement in elections. This panel leverages the diversity of distinct armed actors and regional contexts to better understand the myriad ways in which violence and democracy intersect.
Two Discussants will offer their comments: Professor Sarah Z. Daly and Professor Niloufer Siddiqui have made important contributions to our understanding of political violence in democracies. Their regional knowledge of Latin America and South Asia, respectively, lends itself to a robust intraregional dialogue. Professor Lauren E. Young, whose research on coercion, violent actors, and elections spans multiple continents, will serve as Chair. Together, the papers on this panel provide insight into conditions of violence and insecurity under democracy and how state, armed nonstate, and civilian actors interact as a result. Furthermore, the panel brings into conversation four countries that are seldomly discussed together, enabling a rich discussion of the similarities and differences of political violence across democratic contexts.","Lauren E Young University of California, Davis","Sarah Zukerman Daly Columbia University

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 12: Comparative Politics of Developing Countries,,September 17,pm,4:00,5:30,Mobilizing Political Participation in Africa,"The political engagement of citizens is widely regarded as vital for democracy. From Tocqueville to Putnam and beyond, a significant literature has demonstrated that nations with higher levels of overall political participation have better performing governments than those where only a small fraction of the citizenry engage. Despite the known benefits of participation, however, significant questions remain about the extent to which citizens in Africa engage with political processes, and the drivers that affect this participation. To answer these questions, this panel brings together cutting-edge researchers from Africa, North America and Europe, who draw on rich empirical evidence and a wide variety of methodologies. Taken together, these contributions add important insights to an emerging literature that explores the drivers of electoral and non-electoral political participation in Africa.
The panel opens with a paper by Jöst et al, which uses a novel survey experiment to explore the drivers of political participation around the 2021 Zambian national elections. Contrary to widely held assumptions in the literature, they find that partisanship is a critical driver of non-voting activity, with social incentives and ethnicity playing important, but less significant roles. They also explore the role of both community and leader sanctioning in shaping this participation, and find that citizens anticipate negative repercussions if they fail to support a co-partisan candidate, with important implications for democratic development throughout the region.
Following this, Young and Dendere take up and explore further the issue of social incentives, with a pre-analysis plan for a field experiment on voter registration in Zimbabwe. Partnering with a civil society organization, they explore the impact that social incentives, and, specifically, the belief that others will observe and reward your voting behavior, have on voters in a hybrid regime where the costs of voting are often high. They hypothesize that social incentives are likely to be a particularly powerful motivator of political participation, suggesting that training peer mobilizers to register friends and family to vote may be an important mobilizing tactic in regimes with low turnout.
Third, Owura Kuffuor sheds light on the ways in which presidential candidates strategically mobilize votes from non-co-ethnic voters, through the allocation of legislative race funding. Using survey data from Malawi, he examines the impact that the ethnic make-up of communities has on the allocation of legislative campaign funds, and argues that parties are likely to allocate more campaign funds in constituencies where the presidential candidate is from a minority ethnic group. In so doing, he argues, presidential candidates are able to use legislative race funding to mobilize support for themselves from voters they might otherwise struggle to reach.
And finally, Gadjanova et al explore factors affecting the ways in which political parties use WhatsApp for both intra-party communications and to reach and mobilize voters. Through a comparison of Nigeria and Ghana, they show that pre-existing party strength and institutionalization are the main factors affecting social media use, with strong parties able to create formal messaging approaches, while weak parties rely on informal, personality-based online structures. Additionally, they show that existing patrimonial structures are replicated online, and that social media therefore restricts the empowerment of new actors and compounds pre-existing weaknesses, with important implications for political participation and democracy more broadly.",Rachel Beatty Riedl Cornell University,"Rachel Beatty Riedl Cornell University

This panel draws on four papers examining social mobility, two looking at the role of experienced of mobility and two looking at future beliefs about mobility. Collectively, the panelists interrogate the concept of social mobility, and its connection to core economic and political preferences. Gingrich, Giudici and McArthur examine at how different education systems shape pathways of mobility, tracing the mobility process from the family through the school system to preferences. Weber examines the effects of experienced social mobility on preferences towards redistribution, showing that those who experience it often fail to attribute upward mobility to social institutions. Ansell, Cansunar, Beramendi, Haslberger and Bokobza develop an original cross-national survey of perceptions of future mobility, examining beliefs about the extent of mobility, and the distribution attitudes within countries across local mobility contexts. Fetscher and Rueda also offer an original experimental study, examining how future perceptions of the fairness of mobility processes shape attitudes towards redistribution. In examining the causes and downstream consequences of different understandings of social mobility, this panel breaks new ground at connecting mobility paths to preferences.",Jane R.

While global trading rules were initially dominated by multilateral agreements like the GATT and World Trade Organization (WTO), states have turned back to regional and bilateral PTAs and shallow trade facilitation agreements in the last decade. Similarly, the rules governing the treatment of foreign direct investment (FDI) have been dominated by the use of model BITs, but what was once a negotiations process dominated by templates has changed, both in terms of the substance of treaties and how the deals are struck. This panel investigates the sources of changing PTA and BIT negotiation strategies, and the resulting impacts on treaty content and state behaviour. The panel documents changes in negotiation strategies, such as the strategic exit of BITs by states to prompt renegotiation, as well as the increased effort by subnational units to negotiate memorandums of understanding (MOU) and individual FDI agreements with foreign states. Likewise, not all negotiation efforts towards PTAs have been successful, with increased rates of negotiation failure after 2001. Additionally, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected the way states can interact with one another. While both bilateral and multilateral economic negotiations traditionally have been conducted with a physical presence, travel restrictions have forced states to move negotiations to virtual platforms. As such, the papers on this panel collectively investigate new horizons in the negotiation of international trade and investment agreements in the 21st century using a variety of innovative data collection techniques, as well as multi-method analyses.",Sarah Bauerle Danzman Indiana University,"Taylor St John University of St Andrews

When do state sponsors increase the potential for civil war onset? How does external intervention shape a complicated landscape of armed groups at the local level, and how might competition between state sponsors affect local conflict? Can sponsors successfully manage their local proxies, and how might they do so? Is the conventional wisdom correct that proxy war is a low-cost way to fight and limit conflict escalation? The papers on this panel approach these questions using a variety of methodological and empirical approaches, such as quantitative analysis of novel data and case studies of historical and contemporary proxy wars.

Whether in the events of civil war, earthquake or other natural disasters, assassination, coup, or in less obvious ways, environmental disasters, poisoning of cities, mass migrations associated with climate change, new nationalisms and/or emergent forms of political economy encouraging political repression, catastrophe is a phenomenon that in itself can have profound consequences for democratic rule, human rights, and, indeed, human existence itself. Indeed, it also makes us reconsider the philosophies of time that have shaped much of modern, western thought.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 31: Women and Politics Research,,September 17,pm,4:00,5:30,From Past to Present: Pathways to Women’s Political Engagement,"Women have long faced not only institutional, but also structural and cultural barriers to their full political engagement. Even when women secured the vote, the barriers to realizing their full potential as political beings trailed behind men’s. While women’s turnout in several countries now surpasses that of men’s, women in many countries are still less likely to participate in political protests or be elected or appointed to political offices. This panel investigates the pathways of women to political engagement through the historical lens, from the time of women’s pre-democratic participation to suffrage mobilization to today's barriers to political participation of women in both the developed, democratic and developing, non-democratic countries. The panel brings together four very distinct papers that study different time periods, regions and apply distinct methodologies, but which together document how barriers to women’s political engagement hindered their participation in politics in the past and continue doing so now. The panelists, however, also offer several positive, hopeful solutions, documenting the innovative ways in which women’s underrepresentation in politics can be overcome.
In the first paper, Carissa Tudor (Brown University) explores the roots of the institutional barriers to political participation of women that excluded them from voting. Building on her work that documents women’s pre-democratic political participation in Europe, she compares France and the UK through a most different systems design. Relying on extensive archival and primary sources, she investigates why women were institutionally excluded from modern political participation in the first place.
In the second paper, co-authored by Mona Morgan-Collins (King’s College London) and Valeria Rueda (University of Nottingham), the panelists demonstrate how suffragists helped women to overcome cultural barriers to political participation as voters and candidates after they secured the vote. Taking advantage of a natural experiment spurred by the 1913 suffragist march in the U.K., they demonstrate that a mere exposure to suffragists helped to break down the perceptions that politics was for men only, leaving women unsuited to discuss politics, vote or to rule.
In the third paper, Ana Weeks (University of Bath), documents how structural barriers continue to reduce women’s political engagement in the United States to this day. Taking advantage of novel survey data on household division of labour, the panelist demonstrates how women continue not only to shoulder disproportionate amount of household work, but also carry a disproportionate amount of mental load of ‘running’ a household, such as anticipating, fulfilling and monitoring household needs. She argues that once mental load is taken into account, the household gender gap has an even more profound effect on political engagement of women.
The final paper, co-authored by Carolyn Barnett (Princeton University) and Marwa Shalaby (University of Wisconsin), considers how cultural and institutional barriers work together to impact women’s electoral success as candidates in local politics in the non-democratic setting of contemporary Morocco. Using an original dataset of electoral outcomes across more than 1500 municipalities and interviews conducted with local party officials and elected councilors, the authors argue that a culture of clientelism and patronage networks combined with a majoritarian electoral system (SMD) tends to favor more connected, male candidates who are predominantly viewed by voters as capable service providers over women who suffer from a ‘newcomer’ status and weak party affiliation.",Christina Wolbrecht University of Notre Dame,"Diana Z.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 45: Human Rights,,September 17,pm,4:00,5:30,"International Criticism, Public Opinion, and Human Rights","One of the primary tools of the international society to enforce compliance with human rights norms is “naming and shaming” (Hafner-Burton 2008; Terman and Byun 2021). By publicly pointing and condemning governments’ wrongdoings, different actors try to change governments’ behavior by moving public opinion and mobilizing. This panel brings together four papers that study the links between international criticism and public opinion, highlighting multiple actors involved in this process along multiple stages.
Greenhill begins our discussion by focusing on the decision of international organizations to voice criticism. Examining why do (some) international organizations express their concerns regarding (some) human rights issues, the paper considers the interests of the member states steering the organization as well as the beliefs of the organization’s leadership and staff.
The next two papers study the impact of international criticism on public opinion in the target country. Chong et al. study the impact on international pressure in the context of anti-discrimination laws in Japan. In contrast to many accounts that suggest that international criticism increases public support for human rights, the paper finds no support for change in public opinion. Abramson, Menon, and Gitlin use an experimental design to examine Israeli public response to criticism voiced by different actors: a domestic one, a diasporic one, or a foreign one. Both papers suggest that the impact of international criticism on public opinion is dependent on certain cultural, social, and political predispositions that are important to account for.
Finally, Búzás and Bassan-Nygate study the impact of “counter-shaming” – one of the strategies used by targeted governments to deflect international criticism. Their paper shows that counter-shaming, which uses alternative normative frames, can influence public opinion abroad, thus mitigating the effects of international criticism.
Overall, the four papers join the burgeoning research studying the conditions under which “naming and shaming” influence public opinion (Gruffydd-Jones 2019; Marinov 2021; Tingley and Tomz 2021). The different papers examine states, non-state actors, and international organizations along multiple stages of the process – the decision to criticize, the influence of the criticism, and the impact of counter-criticism.",Alexandra Arons Siegel University of Coloardo Boulder,Rochelle Layla Terman University of Chicago,"Intergovernmental Organizations and Public Perceptions of Human Rights - Brian D.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 48: Health Politics & Health Policy,,September 17,pm,4:00,5:30,The Politics and Organization of the Public Health and Health Care Workforce,"While the COVID-19 pandemic thrust members of the public health and health care workforce into even more central and intensive roles as practitioners, communicators and policymakers, members of these workforces have long-shaped the health systems and the trajectory of health policy change and implementation across nations. As countries confront the policy challenges of COVID-19 and the system failures that were exacerbated and highlighted by the pandemic, it will be crucial to understand the role the public health and health care workforces play in the restructuring of health policy in the post-pandemic world. The papers in this panel examine how the political identification, political action, and political perceptions of the public health and health care workforces shape policy implementation, health system functioning, and accountability. In their paper, “Workers Not Warriors: Health Worker Protests in the COVID-19 Era,” Brophy and Sriram develop a framework to understand the variation in health worker protests and the impact of protests on health system accountability. In their examination of public health officers in Montana and Oregon, Camarillo and Barsky examine how the politicization of the public health workforce impacts the ability of county health organizations to respond to public health emergencies. Returning to a focus on the health care workforce, Washburn et al. investigate the role of primary care physicians as public health messengers, finding that while generally supportive of public health measures like vaccine mandates, the political identification of a primary care physician importantly influences the type of public health message physicians are likely to convey.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 49: Canadian Politics,,September 17,pm,4:00,5:30,Canadian Party Systems in Flux: Federal and Provincial Trends,"The Canadian party systems are unique in various ways. For instance, while the first-past-the-post electoral system currently adopted in Canada induces the electoral domination of two political parties – one on the left, and one on the right –, several Canadian provinces are characterized by a multiparty system (Johnston 2017; Bélanger 2017). Further, unlike other systems that are vertically integrated, there are significant party system differences across levels of government, with some provinces having political parties that have no equivalent at the federal level (Stewart, Sayers and Carty 2016).
Given the peculiarities of the Canadian party systems, and the limitations of extant comparative work to explain some of its dynamics, much research has been conducted on these systems, yielding the development of an extensive literature on this topic. Yet some relevant aspects of the Canadian party systems remain undertheorized: specifically, to what extent do major and minor parties depend on different types of donors? What is the relationship between voters and party leaders in Canada? How have provincial-level political parties evolved with respect to relevant policy domains? And what explains the recent evolution of the party system in Quebec?
Each of these important questions are addressed by a cohesive and conceptually synergetic set of four papers. The first paper by Cochrane, Snider and Schwartz examines the intersection of public policy, party finance, spending, and electoral competition. It does so by combining an analysis of cross-time and cross-provincial variation in political financing regimes with a new comprehensive dataset of the historical records of political donations to federal and provincial parties. The second paper by Bittner explores the relationship between voters and party leaders in Canada by tracking longitudinal data from the Canadian Election Studies. The third paper by Vanhooren investigates the evolution of Canadian provincial party systems, including the directional divergence (convergence) of parties over policy issues, and the stability (instability) of individual parties’ issue space over time, with a novel dataset of provincial party platforms, and Bayesian latent variable modelling. The fourth paper by Montigny studies the evolution of the partisan system in Quebec in relation to Quebec nationalism, with a focus on the 2018 election, which led to the formation, for the first time, of a majority government by the Coalition Avenir Québec. Taken together, these four papers advance importance knowledge on undertheorized aspects of Canadian party systems while outlining new avenues for advancing scholarship on these systems across varied contexts and over time.

Using historical natural experiments, the four papers causally study the consequences of different political institutions whose reforms are at the center of scholarly and policy debates today, from non-partisan elections and civil service reform to antitrust policies and race-conscious remedial policies. Carreri, Payson and Thompson study progressive era municipal reforms and their impact on the relative wellbeing of immigrants and native-born residents across cities in the U.S. at the turn of the 20th century. Paulsen also focuses on local governments and leverages a governance reform in early 20th century Sweden to study the electoral impact of party-centered electoral institutions at the local level. Allen, Scheve and Stasavage also focus on the progressive era in the U.S. as well as other case studies to analyze the relationship between strong antitrust policy, democracy, and inequality. Aneja and Grumbach exploit the onset of court-mandated affirmative action plans in U.S. law enforcement agencies to study the electoral effects of affirmative action mandates.",David Stasavage New York University,"Mark Dincecco University of Michigan

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 7: Politics and History,,September 17,pm,4:00,5:30,Interest Group and Party Alliances in Historical Perspective,"This panel presents research reassessing the relationships and influence of political parties and interest groups in American history; it focuses on how interactions between groups and parties play out over time and are affected by broader political, economic, and social shifts. Scholarship has long shown that groups and parties form alliances and work together to increase their probability of political success. But creating and maintaining such alliances is not easy, as leaders in the different organizations may disagree on political strategy or policy preferences, or may find it difficult to convince their constituents of the necessity of such cooperation. Papers included in this panel will aim to answer a variety of questions related to group and/or party alliances – such as: when do parties follow the preferences of interest groups and when do they deviate from them? Does the frequency and depth of bonds between groups and parties vary over time and, if so, why? Under what conditions can interest groups cooperate and how do they go about doing so? How do interest groups exist within ‘big tent’ political parties in which they may be a minority group?
The panel will consist of four papers. Laura C. Bucci looks at the changing relationship between the Democratic Party and organized labor in the post-1970s era. Bucci argues that, as union membership decreased in this period, the Democratic Party shifted towards a message centered on individual rights and effort. Katherine Krimmel assesses the rise of programmatic political parties in the United States in the period after 1950 and argues that American parties over time have come to rely more on interest groups in their policy positioning. Andrew Proctor looks at support for LGB policies among elites in the Democratic Party between 1980-2012 to assess whether gay and lesbian Americans constitute a ‘captured group’ within the party in this period. Proctor shows that gay and lesbian Democrats had support from other marginalized groups in the party but for most of this period were out of line with the dominant forces within the party. Finally, Boris Heersink and Matthew J. Lacombe look at the conditions under which groups that seemingly have little to no connections can come to form an alliance. Heersink and Lacombe present case studies of the Coors boycott in the US (which united gay activists and Teamsters) and the 1984-85 Miners Strike in the UK (which created an alliance between a gay and lesbian group in London and a mining community in Wales), and argue that political entrepreneurs within groups can forge cooperation by highlighting shared threats, creating or accentuating shared ideological convictions, and building institutional ties.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 7: Politics and History,,September 17,pm,4:00,5:30,The South in American Political Development,"The South has always had an outsized influence on American political development. The evil of slavery degraded the political structure and southern society while generating great wealth for the region and the nation. As the southern political economy became more dependent on slave labor and the population and power of free states swelled, perceived threats to the corrupt slave system led to war. In the aftermath of defeat, southern conservatives managed to secure white supremacy and a brutal racial hierarchy that was, for many years, sanctioned through federal neglect – a tenuous arrangement that set the stage for some of the great domestic dramas of the modern American state. This panel explores the place of the South in American political development from a variety of perspectives. Robert Mickey and David Waldner examine the failure of Reconstruction and develop a broader theory for explaining the relative success of nation-building efforts. This theory is rooted in state capacity and its effects on the coalitional possibilities in the ""nation"" undergoing occupation. Susanne Schwarz investigates to what extent ex-Confederate states strategically used penal institutions to consolidate their finances when political support for taxation was limited in the decades following the Civil War. Kirstine Taylor considers the post-WWII era and argues that the transformation from Jim Crow chain gangs to modern prisons demonstrates that carceral modernization and reform often lead to devastating expansions to the punitive power of the state. And Paul Herron traces the use of time and temporal rhetoric in public debates over the ""Old South"" and the ""Lost Cause"" by both Black and white southerners – debates that continue today around statues and other memorials to Confederate soldiers and politicians. These papers are all rooted in careful historical analysis, and the discussion will show how the legacies of the past affect southern and American politics today.",Elizabeth Sanders Cornell University,"Robert C.

In spite of the global applaud for so-called “K-Quarantine,” various governmental preventive measures have provoked political controversies between people in different ideological camps in the context of increasing partisan polarization. Are the democratic processes in Korea properly responding to chronic challenges posed by the polarization or to new ones posed by the pandemic? How and to what extent have the patterns of political responsiveness in Korea changed during the pandemic?

Torres and Karim’s paper investigates the determinants of sexual violence in post conflict societies using novel neighborhood-level data. Vincent’s paper shows that post-conflict states can provide new opportunity structures for women conditional on the willingness and ability of political elites in incorporating security measures for women. Fox, Torres, and Karim’s paper introduces original survey data from members of security forces to test the concept of the gendered protection norm, the idea that men are the natural protectors and that women and children should not be put in harm’s way.

The paper finds that higher EU news consumption leads to more inclusive attitudes, while the effects of Russian news consumption are mixed. Next, Soroka and Krawatzek investigate just how differently Russians and Ukrainians view specific historical topics, such as the Ukraine famine and the role of Stalin, with results that have implications for Ukrainian identity. Feinstein then considers how attitudes in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine have changed in response to Russian military presence in those regions, including a comparative analysis of national identity across three Ukrainian regions. Finally, Shevel looks at the role of the Orthodox faith in Ukrainian identity, especially in the aftermath of the establishment of an independent Orthodox Church of Ukraine.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 11: Comparative Politics,,September 17,pm,12:00,1:30,"Protesters, Soldiers and the State: Re-Examining Military Response to Resistance","Widespread public resistance poses a common dilemma for military organizations, as they are often forced to choose between supporting the regime or backing protesters, and must decide whether to respond with restraint or with violence. These choices are further complicated by the military’s degree of autonomy, as well by the fraught relationships between soldiers, officers, competing units, and with broader society. Under what conditions do militaries choose violence over restraint in the face of public resistance? With a wide range of survey data, archival evidence and novel datasets, the papers on this panel address this question through re-examination of the historical structures shaping civil-military relations and the relationship between the army and society; and by considering the agency of officers and individual soldiers operating within these durable structures. Two papers from Pruett, and from Casey, Slater and LaChapelle consider the contested origins of military organizations, while work from Mattingly and Grewal highlights internal variation within the armed forces. Casey, et al. examine the varied autonomy of military organizations in regimes that emerged from violent conflict, helping explain why armies in some rebel regimes defend the state against mass protest, while others seize power for themselves. Pruett considers how European responses to widespread resistance shaped the ethnic make-up of colonial militaries in Francophone West Africa, demonstrating the limitations of existing, Anglocentric theories on legacies of ethnic bias in the armed forces. Mattingly’s chapter draws on new data on the strategic deployment of specific units in China’s People’s Liberation Army during the 1989 protests to understand how party elites navigated officer’s social ties to ensure the military would crack down on student protests despite their sympathies. With experimental findings from a survey in Algeria, Grewal highlights preferences of individual soldiers for restraint or repression, shedding light on why the Algerian military adopted widely different responses to recurrent protests between 1988 and 2020.",Lindsay P.

Therefore, how political parties strategically campaign during these short election campaigns is a crucial question with important implications for diverse literature. In this panel, we use an original and recently extended dataset, Comparative Campaign Dynamics, that report parties’ campaign rhetoric across three to five most recent elections in ten European democracies, to answer important questions like when political parties distort their rivals’ messages and how electoral competition affects this rhetoric (Somer-Topcu and Tavits), when parties campaign with references to integrity and how corruption levels affect this discussion (Rafalowski), how parties respond to public preferences in their campaigns (Adams, Bjarnøe, and Feddersen), and how parties address the rise of populist parties through their campaign rhetoric and particularly with the negative campaigning strategy (Riera and Jurado).

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 15: European Politics and Society,,September 17,pm,12:00,1:30,"Sovereignty, Rule of Law and Democracy Challenges in Contemporary Europe","According to Cas Mudde (2004), we are witnessing a populist Zeitgeist in Europe, as populist movements, parties, and policies gain political traction and influence, and increasingly set the political agendas and (contribute to) run governments. Populism is a multifaceted phenomenon and may be said to be an essentially contested concept. Historically populism has served as a clarion call to popular uproar against all forms of elitist rule and repression. In contemporary Europe, especially variants of right-wing populism are more closely married to nationalism. Its proponents step forth as defenders of exclusivist forms of (ethnic) nationalism in an integrating Europe. Precisely how they reconcile their stance with the European integration process is important to clarify. This panel discusses these issues under the heading of sovereignism. Further, we are interested in the effects of populist policies on rule of law and democracy. What type or mode of representation do populist leaders espouse? To what extent and in what sense is this a mode of representation that deviates from established notions of representative party democracy and what are the long-term democratic implications? Further, EU integration has since the EU’s inception unfolded under material, normative, and constitutional constraints imposed by the member states. The ensuing EU-based political order is therefore an incomplete (when compared to a nation-state), biased, and lopsided political order. That the EU is thus constrained brings up the question of the type of interaction effects that exist between populist-driven forms of exclusion, rights-deprivation, and rule of law violations on the one hand, and the EU’s development as a political and constitutional order on the other. How populist actors contribute to the discussions on the future of Europe helps shed added light on these issues.","R. Daniel Kelemen Rutgers University, New Brunswick","R.

Moreover, autocracies are proving that they are perfectly capable of cooperating with one another: bilateral, through non-governmental organizations, through informal consortia and even through formal regional institutions. Authoritarian regimes engage in security cooperation through regional organizations to blunt political challenges, channel aid, and serve legitimating functions, for example through zombie election monitoring.
The effect of the authoritarian turn in international organizations remains poorly understood.

This panel features new research on how signals and rhetoric shape interactions regarding nuclear security. Specifically, the panelists advance the nuclear literature by examining both the intended and unintended effects of communicating intentions in the nuclear realm. The papers revise traditional theories of signaling to account for the unique technological, institutional, and political environments in which states and leaders make choices about nuclear weapons. At the broadest level, Pauly and Volpe introduce a novel theory to explain the changing distinguishability of dual-use technology over time, focusing on how the Nuclear Suppliers Group shapes the information environment in which proliferators make investments in civilian or military technologies. Gibbons explains the constraining effects of even vague treaty commitments, focusing on the evolving history of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty’s disarmament provisions and their unintended consequences for nuclear deterrence. Post examines how a specific kind of rhetoric – moral language – constrains the ability of nuclear states to successfully negotiate with proliferating nations. Finally, Gheorghe and Sukin use survey experiments to explore the interdependence of patrons’ commitments to allies; specifically, they examine how Turkish and Greek populations view the implications of U.S. signals of credibility for their own defense.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 21: Conflict Processes,,September 17,pm,12:00,1:30,Conceptual and Methodological Issues in the Study of Electoral Violence,"Scholars have increasingly come to recognize the importance of election-related violence and the benefits of studying it as a distinct form of conflict. Yet despite a growing literature on the topic, there remains a lack of consensus when it comes to defining, categorizing, and measuring such violence. The papers in this panel generate new insights into the conceptualization, measurement, and scope of electoral violence,. Rosenzweig and Siddiqui propose a definition of election-related violence that they suggest is expansive enough to capture the forms of violence that fall under the concept while simultaneously distinguishing it from other instances of violence and coercion, and they discuss which means of categorizing election-related violence are likely to be more or less analytically useful and why. Arriola et al collect data from four distinct types of sources — civil society monitors, local leaders, citizens, and media — to compare their effectiveness in generating data on various forms of electoral coercion and violence, identifying tradeoffs associated with each data source in terms of validity, accuracy, scalability, and cost that can inform efforts to generate reliable, replicable, and low-cost means for collecting data on electoral violence in diverse settings. Barnes and Albarracín investigate the impact of gang territorial control on municipal-level elections in Rio de Janeiro, where drug trafficking gangs have monopolized violence in hundreds of favelas and dominate local politics by offering cooperative parties and politicians unfettered access to voters in their territories during election campaigns. Finally, Birch assesses the effect of tropical storms on electoral contention over seven elections held in the Philippines between 1992 and 2010, applying a new lens to the study of the electoral conflict. The papers advance the study of election-related violence by providing greater clarity about how it should be defined, categorized, and measured, and on its relationship to analogous concepts.",Megan Turnbull University of Georgia,"Megan Turnbull University of Georgia

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 3: Normative Theory,,September 17,pm,12:00,1:30,Questioning the Foundations of Liberal Egalitarianism in a Post-pandemic World,"Recent political developments have put pressure on many bedrock assumptions of liberal egalitarian theory. Largely taken for granted by proponents in recent decades, these assumptions are facing challenges amid deepening political polarization, the radical emergency responses that democratic states have adopted during the current pandemic, and the alarming ecological dimensions of the pandemic itself. This panel responds by reexamining bedrock liberal egalitarian assumptions. The aim is to take seriously recent challenges to liberal egalitarianism and contribute to an investigation of whether and how liberal egalitarian theory could retain currency in the world today.
Thomas Christiano addresses the assumption of fundamental and equal moral status, building on a Millian notion of imperfect, collective rational activity to argue that differences in individual rational capacity do not justify unequal moral status. Turning to an explosive source of contemporary conflict, Pablo Gilabert explores the relation and tensions between self-esteem—one of the grounding goods of many egalitarian theories—and social competition. Jiewuh Song finds ruptures in the commonly presumed dichotomy between anti-discrimination policies like affirmative action and merit-based competition. Finally, David Schmidtz interrogates the ideal of human equality underpinning the pressing project of ecological justice.
Together, these papers throw into relief widely held liberal egalitarian commitments and seek to clarify their conditions of justifiability. The project of doing so takes on urgency amid the fissures and inequalities that have been laid bare as the world attempts to emerge from its current, prolonged state of emergency.",Catherine Lu McGill University,Ryan Pevnick New York University,"Discrimination and Competition - Jiewuh Song, Seoul National University

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 30: Urban Politics,,September 17,pm,12:00,1:30,Inequalities in Local Participation and Transparency: Learning from New Data,"Local policymaking shapes many public services that affect citizens daily: land use control and housing are predominantly controlled by local governments, as are policing, public transit, waste collection, and parks and recreation. Local policies also affect global efforts to address climate change. The strength of local public transit affects emissions, the density of housing development affects rates of car ridership, etc. This panel brings together a set of papers that examine participation and transparency in the formulation and operation of these vital local public services.
A first set of papers examines how the design of local decision-making processes—especially their accessibility and transparency—affects who participates and the decisions that are reached. Drawing on novel national survey data and a series of survey experiments, Einstein and co-authors investigate how perceptions of democratic inclusion in local political proceedings can contribute to the overrepresentation of homeowners, and whether these perceptions can be altered with more information and transparency about local political inequalities and public policies. Meanwhile, Nall and collaborators assess the effectiveness of an online system they have developed, through which citizens can deliberate with each other and their elected representatives regarding housing policy in Southern California. A second set of papers investigates the circumstances under which local governments choose to be transparent regarding their policies and services, and the implications of these decisions. Gordon and Hughes analyze novel data on which cities choose to publish their climate policies and progress towards meeting climate-related goals, and the extent to which disclosures are framed for local versus global audiences. Post and co-authors present new data on the types of California jurisdictions that have moved most quickly to publish public transit feeds that can be integrated into google maps and have kept this information up-to-date during the pandemic, a period during which many agencies cut back services due to plummeting ridership. Overall, the papers highlight important inequalities in terms of access to local decision-making processes and information regarding what government is actually doing, and provide preliminary evidence suggesting ways in which such inequalities could be at least partially redressed.",Jamila D.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 31: Women and Politics Research,,September 17,pm,12:00,1:30,Violence Against Women and Abortion Decriminalization in Latin America,"This session brings together novel and recent research about violence against women (VAW) and abortion legalization in Latin America. Merike Blofield and her co-authors’ paper seeks to assess and explain policy efforts on VAW and children in nine Latin American countries. Mariela Daby and Mason Moseley examine the politics of abortion in the region. Their paper seeks to explain why some Latin American countries legalized abortion while others have not, what explains the expansion of circumstances under which abortion is legal in certain contexts and retrenchment in others. Caroline Beer’s paper studies the decriminalization of abortion in Mexico. Most abortions were illegal in Mexico until 2007, when the Mexico City government decriminalized abortion, allowing abortion for any reason during the first twelve weeks of pregnancy. In response, an anti-abortion backlash unfolded in other states across the country, and no other state decriminalized abortion until 2019, when the state of Oaxaca passed legislation to decriminalize abortion. Beer’s paper explains the transformation of abortion politics in the last few years. Cora Fernández Anderson’s paper focuses on abortion reform in Chile. The paper examines current political changes in Chile, including the rise of a movement-Left party with strong roots in the student and feminist movements, to explore the implications for abortion reform. The session will be chaired by Christina Ewig, and papers will be discussed by Mala Htun and Christina Ewig.",Christina Ewig University of Minnesota,"Christina Ewig University of Minnesota

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 8: Political Methodology,,September 17,pm,12:00,1:30,Discerning Signal from Noise in Practice,"The sciences in general have recently been shaken by a replication crisis. One common research challenge that feeds into this crisis is that the world often gives us substantially less information than we need to be confident in the results of our statistical tests. Navigating this situation in practice is both challenging and critical to producing credible research. Our papers speak to this issue.
Researchers seeking increased precision are often willing to trade a small increase in bias for large gains in precision. However, it is not obvious when such gains in precision should be expected to outweigh the increase in bias. Bowers, Diaz, and Grady give guidance for how researchers should deal with this trade-off when estimating average treatment effects. Using simulations and an analysis of a block-randomized messaging field experiment with rare and skewed outcomes, they provide guidelines to address the bias-precision trade-off at the pre-analysis planning stage so that researchers can make informed decisions about the choice of estimator for the average treatment effect in randomized experiments.
Slough and Tyson present a framework for allowing more productive discussions around replications. They argue that most replication studies in political science are ""conceptual replications,"" rather than “direct replications,” and they employ a theoretical implications of empirical models approach to consider the implications of changes in setting (or population), instruments (treatment conditions), and measurement strategies for what can be learned from the comparison of results of a study and a replication.
Arel-Bundock, Briggs, and Mendoza Aviña examine statistical power in published political science research. Examining about 16,000 analyses contained within about 2,000 articles nested within 56 meta-analyses published in political science journals, they show that statistical power is very low. Even with generous assumptions, the median test has less than 10% power (with alpha = 0.05) and fewer than 10% of all tests achieve 80% power. They discuss the implications of this result and show results from a survey of political methodologists asked to predict the statistical power of the analyses in their sample.",Corrine M.

Full Paper Panel,NA,"Related Groups / Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Caucus",Division 47: Sexuality & Politics,September 17,pm,12:00,1:30,Made for TV? Marriage and Family Politics and Policy in the (Post) Pandemic Era,"The APSA 2020 theme, "" Rethink, Restructure, and Reconnect: Towards A Post-Pandemic Political Science"" challenges political scientists to “to rethink almost everything about our discipline” in light of the “global pandemic, deepening political polarization, and mass organized protests demanding social justice and systemic change.” Our panel gathers scholars who are rethinking how we analyze and understand the politics of marriage and family life in the United States. While we often think of the end of bans on interracial marriage (Loving v. Virginia, 1967) and the legalization of same-sex marriage (Obergefell v. Hodges, 2015) as major historical and political milestones here, the Covid-19 pandemic brought marital and other familial issues to the fore in an unprecedented way. Not only were many weddings canceled or postponed, but many Americans spent more—or less—time with their family units than ever before, working, going to school, and conducting much of the other business of daily life at home. Showing, as feminist scholars have long argued, that the distinction between the public and private spheres has always been tenuous at best, the pandemic lockdowns brought into sharp relief how broader issues of domestic labor, violence, and economic strain, among so many others, are deeply linked to marital and family life.
United by their focus on marriage and/or family policy issues, broadly defined, the papers on this panel re-think and re-imagine how we consider marital and family politics and policy, particularly from the perspective of popular culture. This focus is important because during the lockdowns, many Americans spent more time watching television and movies; therefore, their time with families (or lack thereof) was often defined by and represented through their engagement with popular culture. This panel therefore considers how popular cultural products such as television shows, movies, and celebrity gossip reflect, complicate, and shape how we understand marriage and families in the United States, with a focus on the elevation of certain types of normative marriage and/or family configurations. Specifically, the papers consider how the growing popularity of the Lifetime show ""Married at First Sight"" tracks the declining appeal of marriage “off screen,” and what this teaches us about the broader politics of race, gender, class, and sexuality in the US; gay and lesbian celebrities’ efforts to further LGBTQ family legislation at the state level and the implications of this activism for LGBTQ family policy in the wake of Obergefell; and, finally, how popular culture helped transform LGBT people from dangerous perverts who threatened family and state, to military heroes and respectable parents. Altogether, by examining the growing interplay between marriage and family policy and politics and popular culture, this panel will provide important insights into APSA 2022’s central concern with politics and political science in the post-pandemic era.",Anthony Nownes,"Anthony Nownes

This panel contributes to the emerging scholarship on race and racism in international relations, with a focus on international security. We bring together scholars who advance diverse theoretical perspectives and methodological approaches to the subject, ranging from critical International Relations and qualitative case studies to the quantitative study of public opinion surveys and experiments. Zoltán I. Búzás theoretically engages how race factors into reputation costs in IR, exploring the role of concerns about appearing (non-)racist in shaping US nuclear policy in the 1950s and information campaigns during the Cold War. Yoon Jin Lee draws from insights in critical International Relations to discuss the theoretical and practical implications of racial underpinnings for democratic credibility. David Ebner explores the racial microfoundation of foreign security policy preferences, demonstrating the key role white identity and racial conservatism in shaping public support for U.S. defense spending.

Covid-19 did not just impact national government’s responses to immigration, it also significantly shaped the experiences of exclusion and inclusion of migrants on the ground and at varying levels of governance. This panel brings varying approaches and levels of analyses to uncover the varying ways that immigrants, immigrant serving organizations, local governments, and public perception about immigrants, were all impacted by Covid-19. Jennifer Martinez focuses on the importance of farmworkers in the United States as “essential workers” and documenting how their translocal and transnational networks offered critical support during the Covid-19 pandemic. Jennie Schulze explores the reactionary politics at the national level and the COVID-19 pandemic places new strains on immigrant communities and service organizations, looking at new migration settlement in suburban and rural areas of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Robert Courtney Smith and Andres Besserer Rayas analyze highly Covid-impacted undocumented, Latinx, immigrant families in New York City Covid epicenters to study the impact of New York’s 2.1 billion dollar Excluded Workers Fund (EWF) – one of the few funds set up to support undocumented immigrants who were excluded from national funds – the health and wellbeing of different groups of immigrant populations.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 1: Political Thought and Philosophy,,September 18,am,8:00,9:30,Vulnerability and Marginalization in the History of Political Thought,"This session assembles three papers that tackle themes of vulnerability and marginalization as they were understood by thinkers in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. Each paper examines groups that were understood to be peculiarly vulnerable or neglected during these times, with a focus on children, the disabled and the mentally ill. The papers examine proposals of various kinds for addressing the needs of these groups and fixing their place in society. The papers consider arguments about the education of poor and vulnerable children, the relationship between education and sexuality in boys, and the intersection of ableism, segregation, and statistics to justify domestic colonies for the disabled and the mentally ill.
The papers address overlapping themes in the history of political thought, including the relationship between paternalism and liberatory politics, the usefulness of education for social change and the segregation of marginalized groups. All three papers ask us to reconsider the place of people who have often remained afterthoughts in political theory, both by canvassing radical defenses of their rights and by documenting justifications of their oppression.",Lorraine Krall McCrary Wabash College,"Stephen Engelmann University of Illinois, Chicago","Ableism, Statistics and Segregation - Barbara Arneil, University of British Columbia

The papers use a variety of cutting-edge methods including survey experiments, textual analysis, and machine learning to explore the different strategies that elites use to legitimize their rule in the eyes of audiences, both domestic and international. Specifically, the papers examine the role of state media in reframing negative foreign coverage of authoritarian governments; the role of state media coverage of foreign elections in legitimizing authoritarian rule; how public demand for state media coverage depends on the content and beliefs about sources; the role of framing and agenda-setting of morality issues in times of economic crises. Together, these papers reveal how authoritarian elites can use their influence over the media to bolster their power through framing, regime legitimization, agenda-setting, redirecting audience attention, appealing to emotions and identities, and reframing narratives.",Sarah A.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 11: Comparative Politics,,September 18,am,8:00,9:30,Pork-Barreling in Comparative Perspective,"This panel focuses on the multiple roles played by pork barreling in comparative politics. It engages empirical research and political assessments of pork-barreling in distinct institutional and political environments, including Japan, Argentina, the U.S., Brazil, among others. Our goal is to analytically approach the question of the political determinants of pork barreling, and its effects, from the supply-side (politicians) and demand-side (voters). By definition, pork-barreling includes benefits for particular interests, where the costs of providing those benefits are diffused throughout the population. Pork barreling, including the distribution of club goods and clientelistic benefits, is usually viewed in a derogatory light. Nevertheless, pork, has been a very useful instrument for coalition building, especially in a multiparty environment where the party of the ruling government rarely enjoys majority in Congress. It may work as a glue for the building and for the sustaining of governing coalitions generating governability in multiparty settings. It also has an effect on the choice of career legislators make as well as on their prospect of electoral success. Therefore, pork is a key factor to the reelection of legislators and to their prospect for staying in Congress pursuing a legislative career. Voters evaluate their representatives mostly based on their performance at the local level, in their home district, rather than in other factors, which are clearly associated with a career within Congress. Pork is also a public policy and has also been studied as such, with an emphasis on how pork impacts the local level development as well as how voters see pork. The allocation of pork and on its impact on human capital development is another avenue of research. If funds transferred to municipalities by legislators are not effective in reducing inequality, in improving health and educational indicators and in creating jobs and raising income, then we have further confirmation of the dissipative nature of these policies with high costs. On the other hand, if pork policies are allocated broadly and based, at least in part, on technical reasons and have a positive effect on reducing inequality and improving health and educational indicators at the local level, their collective costs will be lower and their dissipative nature less blatant. Hence, the panel also plan to discuss how pork is distributed, how it could work as a tool for coordination between executive and legislative budgetary policy processes, and how it affects local level indicators of human capital. Politicians have a singular point of view: they know (or should) what are their constituencies’ needs and demands. Their reputation and career hinge on the delicate balance of constantly providing and delivering local policies and national projects, in an environment where resources tend to be scarce and competition harsh. On the other hand, bureaucrats and technicians are trained to ponder, to abide by rules, and to justify their choices based on quantifiable and legal criteria. Decisions about the allocation of public resources are made on both grounds. No political decision is deprived of technical criteria. Nonetheless, the pattern of pork policy making is also considered inefficient and irresponsible, as it focuses only on political judgment and in being responsive to immediate electoral and particularistic interests in detriment to the common pool. More responsive policies should consider more technical and universal principles instead.",Barry Ames University of Pittsburgh,Ji Yeon (Jean) Hong University of Michigan,"Dominance through Division: Group-Based Clientelism in Japan - Amy Louise Catalinac, New York University

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 12: Comparative Politics of Developing Countries,,September 18,am,8:00,9:30,"Courts, Accountability, and Democracy in Latin America","This panel revisits the relationship between courts and accountability in Latin America. Particularly it explores the role that informal and formal practices affect the enforcement of the rule of law and accountability at the national and international level. In studying different levels of jurisdiction, the papers contribute to the broader literature on judicial power and explain why some judicial institutions are more empowered than others and why that empowerment has had varying effects on rights protection, control of corruption and political stability over the past several decades. Indeed, following the third wave of democracy, scholars of presidentialism and rule of law either expected accountability mechanisms to remain weak and ineffective (Moreno, Crisp and Shugart 2003; O’Donnell 1998 and 2003, 51) or to grow and deepen with democratization (Alston, Melo, Mueller and Pereira 2016; Sadek and Cavalcanti 2003; Schedler, Diamond and Plattner 1999). What has happened, instead, is considerable intra- and inter- regime variation throughout presidential systems in terms of judicial oversight.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 12: Comparative Politics of Developing Countries,,September 18,am,8:00,9:30,The Formation of Redistributive Preferences in India,"What kinds of beliefs do people in India harbor about how their society’s economic resources ought to be distributed? How are these beliefs shaped, and how are they expressed in citizen-state interactions? This panel brings together four papers that attempt to answer these questions, pivotal for our understanding of social welfare policy, in the context of the world’s largest democracy.
Simon Chauchard and Pavithra Suryanarayan focus on ranked systems – societies in which individuals inherit a social rank at birth – and examine how and why they prevent the emergence of a pro-redistribution majority. In studying why some states are better able to secure the social development of their citizens than others, Prerna Singh shines a light on a relatively underemphasized dimension that is critical to the success of a state’s social policies – popular compliance. Ritika Goel analyzes how redistributive preferences towards the poor as well as meritocratic attitudes change when respondents in India are apprised of low mobility in their country. In a similar vein, Akshay Dixit’s research centers on the role of economic fatalism – the view that an individual’s economic outcomes are beyond one’s control – in shaping support for social welfare and reducing the gap between the rich and the poor.
While examining the factors that shape inequality and preferences for redistribution in India, these papers also speak to the broader literature on redistribution in political science, contributing to our collective understanding of the political and historical factors that make economic outcomes in any society more or less equitable. Chaired by Ashutosh Varshney, with Rachel Brulé and Nikhar Gaikwad as discussants, the panel serves as an avenue to discuss the research frontier in this realm.",Ashutosh Varshney Brown University,"Rachel E.

But who is behind China’s globalizing project? Our panel explores the diverse actors interacting with global China. We show that, while due weight is given to the role of the Chinese party-state, global China is not a solely Chinese-driven enterprise. Instead, a range of private—sometimes Western—actors are involved in facilitating and shaping China’s global influence. These include Western multinational companies, security companies, international NGOs, technology and surveillance firms, PR firms, and law firms. Their roles are often overlooked—or intentionally obscured—in discussions of Chinese influence. Our panel brings together fresh research that prompts a timely examination of the role these actors play in global China. The actors examined here include Western firms, INGOs and Western experts.
Meg Rithmire’s paper examines firm interest and national interests in the context of U.S. firms and China’s globalization. She draws on novel sources of data including private sector testimony in congressional debates, hearings of the U.S.-China Congressional Commission since and a representative sample of U.S. industry associations regarding China. Combined with interviews with U.S. firms and case studies, she develops a typology of state-business interactions in the context of interest divergence. The paper shows that firm interests differ systematically based on sector and highlights the importance of transnational alliances of business interests under interest divergence, illuminating an emerging political economy of national security.
Two papers look at the growing role of International NGOs, often headquartered in the United States or Europe, in China’s globalizing strategy. INGOs are traditionally considered to spread liberal norms, encourage democratization, and foster development from “the West” to “the rest.” With China’s rise, Chinese actors have become major players in in global development finance and international aid. INGOs have never been considered significant in China’s soft-power projection. Farid and Li present findings from a new study that uncovers the role they play in facilitating and shaping China’s outbound aid and investment, focusing specifically on the role of environmental INGOs on environmental governance along BRI countries. Drawing on in-depth interviews, they examine how environmental INGOs work with Chinese government agencies, firms, and NGOs from China and host countries, to mitigate environmental impact caused by Chinese development projects. They develop a typology of INGOs’ intermediary roles based on the content and functions of intermediary support. The study sheds light on the changing dynamics of global environmental governance.
Plantan et al present new evidence from an original dataset of over 130 INGO-China joint activities to promote overseas development. The dataset sheds light on the areas these activities address, what forms they take, and which INGOs and Chinese actors are involved. Specifically, they find that the majority of activities are focused on sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, or more broadly address China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Activities take the form of dialogues such as conferences and meetings, joint research and training, or infrastructure development. Overall, the paper identifies and illuminates an emerging phenomenon that is likely to expand in the future. Findings directly contribute to scholarly literature on transnational partnerships, INGO behavior, and China’s role in world development.
Givens et al examine the role of Western commentators and the predictions they have made about China’s rise. These predictions and recommendations from academic and policy circles influence popular discourse and government, and are monitored and responded to by the Chinese party-state. The paper draws on a coded sample of four decades of academic and policy predictions about China’s rise. Because hard power is relatively abstract outside of actual conflict, the authors focus on the repercussions that understanding of China’s rise had for the country’s ability to build and project soft power, especially in developing regions like sub-Saharan Africa. Ultimately, predictions of China’s rise have more to do with the politics and current concerns of authors, individuals, companies, parties, and states than the emerging reality of China’s rise.
Together, these papers show how Western actors promote, hinder and shape China’s globalizing project in important ways. They therefore serve to complicate the simplistic narrative of the democratic West set against an expanding network of autocratic states by exploring interactions and co-dependence. This panel has significant policy implications in highlighting the sometimes overlooked agency and responsibility of Western actors in global China.",Maria Repnikova Georgia State University,Maria Repnikova Georgia State University,"Business Interests and National Interests in Complex Interdependence - Meg E.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 17: International Collaboration,,September 18,am,8:00,9:30,Public Attitudes on International Cooperation and Conflict,"This panel examines how public opinion at home and abroad shapes the prospects for cooperation and conflict. A large body of international relations scholarship analyzes the link between public attitudes and interstate relations. The papers in this panel provide fresh insights about the drivers of public opinion and their effects on foreign policy decisions.
Theoretically, the papers develop a rich set of explanations that span many important issue areas in world politics. Each contribution examines how public attitudes interact with recent political trends, including polarization, technological change, and the contemporary media environment. Myrick and Wang argue that domestic polarization in the United States shapes both public opinion and foreign policy choices abroad. Brutger and Guisinger argue that domestic public support for trade policy is shaped by the particular frames used in media coverage of factory layoffs. Goldsmith, Horiuchi, and Matush examine how foreign diplomatic travel by U.S. presidents affects their political standing at home – a process that is also shaped by domestic media coverage. Finally, O’Brien-Udry and Pratt argue that public backlash against the misuse of emerging technologies can spill across borders, linking governments’ fate as they manage technological innovation.
Methodologically, the papers use both observational and experimental evidence drawing from numerous countries. Several employ survey experiments to isolate causal effects, while others leverage important political events – including patterns of presidential travel, the US Capitol riot, and unanticipated controversies over technology – to draw causal inferences.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 2: Foundations of Political Theory,,September 18,am,8:00,9:30,"Labor, Freedom, and Solidarity: Looking Forward and Looking Back","This panel turns to the multitudinous tradition of American political thought on labor to rethink received conceptions of domination, freedom, and solidarity. Through historically-situated conceptual analysis, our panelists take up the questions: What does it mean to be dominated under a system of racial capitalism? Why are workers more free when their working hours are limited? How can the reality of worker interdependence contest and transform exclusionary patterns of organization in the labor movement? Can workers alienated from one another by racialized forms of oppression at the same time stand together in solidarity?
Our first set of papers challenges received wisdom about the nature of freedom in the context of labor. In “Capitalism, Slavery, and Domination,” Michael Gorup demonstrates that Black American political thinkers Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Angela Davis develop an analytical framework of racial capitalism that reaches beyond traditional republicanism’s personalized conception of domination. These thinkers’ analysis of American slavery as a regime of accumulation and commodification conceptualizes domination as subjection not only to the arbitrary will of other agents, but also to the arbitrary power of a system of capital. Simone Gubler’s “A Time for Everything: The Case for Limited the Working Week” excavates the rich normative arsenal that American political thought provides for justifying legal limits on the duration of the working day and week. While, in light of its libertarian strand, one might think that American political thought is decidedly hostile to the limited working week, Gubler shows that such limits can be compellingly justified not only on progressive or socialist grounds, but also in the normative idioms of the American founding and Fordism.
Our second set of papers takes up the challenge posed by racial domination and exclusion for labor solidarity. In “Worker Freedom Beyond Mere Independence and Control,” Ki Young Kim tackles the American labor movement’s persistent pattern of securing worker power for some through the racialized exclusion of others. He argues that, in the early 20th century, the International Ladies’ Garment Workers Union offered an alternative conception workers’ interdependence not as a problem for labor power to overcome, but as a value realized through inclusive forms of organizing. Philip Yaure’s “’No Separate Peace:’ Race and Contestatory Solidarity in the United Construction Workers Association” takes up the mechanics of inclusive organizing in the face of white supremacy. He contends that, in the 1970s, the United Construction Workers Association developed a contestatory conception of solidarity that sought to combat employment discrimination in the building trades in Seattle not by papering over racialized differences between white workers and workers of color, but through confrontational struggle for institutional power in the trade unions.
Looking back along the conceptual terrain of labor history, as these papers illustrate, empowers theorists and philosophers to look forward to new formulations of the normative fabric of political community in the workplace and beyond.",Alexander H.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 2: Foundations of Political Theory,,September 18,am,8:00,9:30,Theorizing the Administrative State in Crisis,"Recent events have brought renewed attention to the “administrative state”—the regulatory agencies, bureaucracies, and public offices that implement national as well as trans- and international law, and more broadly constitute modern government. Over the course of the Pandemic, such executive-branch agencies have subsidized vaccine development, issued regulations and guidance to reduce contagion, and stabilized the economy in the midst of broad-scale shutdowns. The powers of the administrative state appear to be at their height. In the midst of our relative isolation, administrative government has become—to borrow the terms of the Foundations of Political Theory section call—one of strongest “social links unit[ing] individuals within and beyond national borders.”
As administration has become yet more prominent, so too has its legitimacy been thrown into deeper crisis. In the United States, an increasingly reactionary Supreme Court has entered into open confrontation with the regulatory state. It has struck down workplace safety regulations and eviction moratoria and set out to limit the government’s ability to combat climate change. Citizens and state governments openly defy federal administrative rules and the claims to professional “expertise” that underlie them. Increasing strains on the European Union’s “functional constitution” (Isiksel 2016) expose the limits of the “lure of technocracy” (Habermas 2015) that Brussels once relied on. Global administrative bodies such as the World Health Organization and the World Bank at once enforce transnational norms and have become the object of ruthless critique.
This panel will examine the challenges posed by the administrative state in the present political constellation, building on over a decade of research on the topic within political theory. Political theorists have probed the deliberative-democratic competencies of this state (Parkinson & Mansbridge, 2012), its relation to the liberal-constitutional order (Heath 2020; Jackson 2021) and to the public sphere (Emerson 2019), its role in creating a common terrain for democratic politics (Klein 2020), its capacity to combat social domination (Rahman 2016), as well as the moral dispositions it fosters and undermines in citizens and officials (Zacka 2017). The panel will continue this conversation by examining normative, institutional, structural, and affective dimension of the administrative state. Coming from a variety of disciplinary perspectives within political theory, and considering several different institutional configurations, the papers converge on a common concern: How do administrative practices and institutions transform, rather than merely reflect or threaten, fundamental political values and relationships? Our goal will be to trace the dialectical and iterative, rather than static and unidirectional, correspondence between political morality and bureaucratic government.
Katharine Jackson challenges the constitutional model of “legislative primacy,” according to which the legislature must make important policy decisions and leave it to administrative bodies to “fill up the details.” She argues instead that administrative agencies should act as “public trustees” that treat citizens as political equals. Pursuing a related line of inquiry, Christopher Havasy aims to develop an account of administrative legitimacy that is not parasitic upon bureaucracies’ control by the constitutional branches of government, but rather built up from below by direct interaction with affected parties. He argues for a norm of “relational fairness,” in which agencies’ treatment of persons may vary relative to those persons’ position within a fragmented and unequal civil society. Steven Klein considers this complex relationship between state and civil society from a different angle, with a focus on financial institutions in particular. Responding to debates around Modern Monetary Theory, he argues that a vision of monetary policy premised on “homogeneous democratic sovereignty” cannot grasp the mutually constitutive relationship between the capitalist economy and the liberal-constitutional state. Taking a turn from high finance to the more intimate personal settings of the welfare state, Bernardo Zacka will examine how physical architecture and design of the “street level bureaucracy” can helps to foster “hope, trust, and confidence” among beneficiaries. His study of Danish public employment offices complements the institutional, normative, and structural accounts provided by the other panelists, respectively, with an affective understanding of administrative institutions as built environments triggering emotional reorientations among beneficiaries.
Blake Emerson will comment on the papers. He will query the relationship between institutions, norms, and emotions in political theories of the administrative state; and ask whether there are fundamental values beyond liberty, democracy, equality, and welfare that are at issues in administrative government.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 21: Conflict Processes,,September 18,am,8:00,9:30,Civil War Paths,"How do conflicts turn violent? How do civil wars unfold over time? How do distinct dynamics of civil war affect the post-war potential for peace? These are the driving questions of the Civil War Paths project “Understanding Civil War from Pre- to Post-War Stages: A Comparative Approach,” funded by a £1.2m UK Research and Innovation Future Leaders Fellowship. Addressing these questions, the papers in this panel analyze the evolution of civil wars in a subset of cases selected for the project from a process-oriented, actor-centered, and relational approach.
Shesterinina outlines the theoretical framework and research design of the project. She argues that civil wars follow different paths based on how they emerge, unfold, and end or transform and traces the foundations of different paths to the organizational origins of non-state armed groups in social movements, clandestine activities, and regime fragmentation. How non-state armed groups form shapes their embeddedness in the territories they seek to control and their capacity to engage with state forces. However, their interactions with other non-state, state, population, and external actors can change these trajectories in the course of hostilities.
Based on this starting point, empirical papers explore path-dependent and endogenous dynamics in cases that represent each of these formations, based on immersive fieldwork in the areas, to understand whether and how armed group origins condition the evolution of civil wars. Ketola examines the case of Nepal where the origins of the CPN-M as a clandestine political party had a significant effect on its strategy and forms of rebel governance. Yet, examining a war-time shift from clandestine to organised path, Ketola argues that endogenous dynamics are key to understanding post-war legacies. Problematizing the social movement origins of armed groups in the case of Lebanon, Rouhana uses a bottom up approach to understand the conditions of possibility for violence at the brink of the war in 1975 and how violence was sustained for the next 15 years at the popular level. Sayra van den Berg focuses on the case of South Sudan where the origins of armed groups in regime fragmentation, particularly a coup d’état attempt, have been widely acknowledged but can be challenged by applying the collective memory framework as the very framing of the violence as a coup shaped mobilization on both sides in the conflict.
Combined, the papers demonstrate the importance of disaggregating organizational trajectories of non-state armed groups for our understanding of different paths civil wars follow and redefine civil war as a complex process that connects the pre-war, war, and post-war stages of conflict through evolving interactions between states, non-state armed groups, local populations, and external actors involved. These findings have implications for future studies of civil war and policy on this dominant form of contemporary armed conflict.",Anastasia Shesterinina The University of Sheffield,"Jessica Maves Braithwaite University of Arizona

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 3: Normative Theory,,September 18,am,8:00,9:30,The Limits of the Market,"A standing problem in political theory is the proper scope and limits of the market in public life. While much progress has been made in recent years due to work by scholars including Elizabeth Anderson and Debra Satz, a number of important questions remain unsettled. For instance, what does it mean for markets to express certain values? What responsibility do individuals as opposed to society have for the outcomes of particular markets? Do markets corrode certain values such as community and friendship? When should we use a market as opposed to collective decision-making for the allocation of particular goods? And so on.
Because the limits of the market raises questions that necessarily cross traditional disciplinary boundaries, this panel will bring together scholars from a wide-range of backgrounds such as political theory, business ethics, and philosophy to answer these questions. The papers on the panel will advance our understanding of the limits of the market partly through looking at how specific goods in markets present important political questions such as: what exactly is wrongful about voting markets and should public funds be used to subsidize the market cost of raising children. We will also use these cases to look at more general questions surrounding the limits of markets including the questions of how expressive values, justice, and community relate to the market.",Abraham A.

The papers investigates diverse questions covering a number of case studies including Morocco, Jordan, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Iran. First paper directly relates to the conference theme as it raises the question of ""who cares?"" by examining the intersection of institutions and political economy during the pandemic in the MENA region. The paper investigates the highly gendered nature of pandemic responses and the disproportionate role that women have played through the care economy both at home and in the market. The second paper investigates the effects of women’s participation in collective action. Using the case of the 2011 Egyptian uprising, the study demonstrates how women’s participation in the uprising has influenced their gender consciousness and feminist subjectivities in the afterlife of activism. Third paper examines how citizens respond to gender representation in legislative committees. The paper implements a series of survey experiments in three case studies and describes a legislative committee’s decision-making process around a gendered issue area, and randomize the committee's gender composition and final decision. Fourth and the last paper focuses on foreign policy. It draws on feminist studies in international relations, human rights law, and political sociology, to map out a Feminist Peace and Security framework (FPS) that complements the world-systems approach. Based on the analysis, the study offers an alternative feminist foreign policy agenda.
The papers are also methodologically diverse. A wide range of methods, such as in-depth interviews, surveys and their quantitative analyses are being utilized and both primary and secondary data are used.
With their diverse foci, cases, methods and data, this panel brings together four papers at the frontier of research on gender in MENA politics. The panel's topic is directly connected to the conference theme because the COVID-19 pandemic has deepened the stratification along the gender lines.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 35: Political Organizations and Parties,Related Groups / Campaign Finance Research Group,September 18,am,8:00,9:30,"Persuasion, Identities, and Campaign Donations","The money used in U.S. election campaigns has almost doubled during the four years between the 2016 and 2020 election cycles. This meteoric rise in campaign spending also means that individuals are now contributing to campaigns in record numbers. Does this change what we know about individual donors? Why do donors contribute to political campaigns, and how do campaigns use what they know to their advantage to persuade donors to open their wallets? The first two papers in this panel encompass research on donor motivations, and the second two papers approach the questions from the campaign's perspective.
Karen Cyphers, Hans Hassell, and Kai Ou, in Partisan and Racial Motivations for Campaign Giving: Evidence from a Field Experiment, presents groundbreaking results on how identities affect campaign donations. How do social and political identities affect donation and voting behavior? Using a randomized field experiment, they identify the effects of information about the donation behavior of other voters who shared the same identity, either partisan or racial. The paper finds that the treatment information of donors who have the same party affiliation significantly promotes donation. In contrast, the information of donors who come from the same racial groups has only a mild effect compared to the control. The authors also find significant variation by racial group, noting that for minorities, information about the behavior of others in their racial group is as powerful or more powerful than information about co-partisan behavior.
Jay Goodliffe, in The Changing Population of Donors, presents a longitudinal study on how a non-donor can evolve to a small donor and eventually to a big donor---or stops giving, i.e., becomes a lapsed donor. Using latent class analysis and latent profile analysis, Goodliffe classifies donors (and non-donors) into different types according to their donation behavior and how much they donate. The paper then use latent transition analysis (i.e., hidden Markov models) to analyze when donors move from one donor type to another type: for example, when a presidential donor starts donating to congressional campaigns, or when a party donor stops donating altogether. Using a panel survey of US citizens, the author examines the characteristics and motivations of new donors, continuing donors, and lapsed donors.
Seo-young Silvia Kim, Jan Zilinsky, and Brian Brew, in Donate To Help Us Fight Back: Persuasion Rhetoric in Political Fundraising, analyze how campaigns use different messages to target the financial electorate as opposed to the voting electorate. Fundraising appeals can potentially appeal to different emotions, issues, and ideological stances than appeals for turnout and vote choice, allowing insights into how campaigns form their strategies. Using data from Facebook Ad Library's pages of congressional candidates for the 2020 general election, Kim, Zilinsky, and Brew distinguish persuasion for donations and votes and identify how campaigns employ different messages for different recipients using text analysis. The authors also analyze how fundraising appeals vary by party, with additional text data from official campaign websites and major fundraising platforms. They find that the language employed by Republican candidates and committees is associated with stronger sentiments such as anger and disgust, with potential implications for demobilization and democracy.
Finally, in Communicating with Donors and Voters Online: How the Incentives of Small-Donor Fundraising Obscure Candidate Positioning, Eric Manning uses official emails from campaigns to analyze how online political communications from campaigns vary by message purpose and audience and the implications for potential donors and voters. As online fundraising grows in importance, email messaging has become increasingly sophisticated, and email lists more valuable assets. Based on campaign emails from 2018--2020 congressional candidates, Manning examines when and how campaigns engage potential donors using issue-based messaging. I find that competitive candidates appealing mainly to potential donors are more negative and less issue-focused than candidates in safer seats. The findings highlight the mechanism by which increasing reliance on small-donor and nationalized online fundraising challenges the ability of potential donors to finance ideologically-congruent candidates. They also demonstrate how such fundraising creates negative externalities for voting non-donors.",Paul S.

Without a utopian vision for putting an end to oppression, exploitation, ecological degradation, climate injustice, and the myriad intersecting problems reinforced by global capitalism? The papers on this panel dance around these questions, asking if liberation requires utopian visioning or if utopian visions are in service of more repressive forces. Bradley Macdonald’s paper uses William Morris to argue that “yes” utopian orientations are essential for breaking the spell of progressive reformism. Tim Luke, on the other hand, offers a portrait of a world where Silicone Valley tech-giants entertain cruel extropian visions of how technology can save their wealth and the lives of their cronies, while draining the earth’s resources and eroding the proletariat’s will to live. Meanwhile, Sean Parson asks, what if none of this is even real—from our framing of the climate crisis to our subjectification of the climate? If oppression is maintained by a simulation, then Parson calls for implosion rather than utopia. Finally, Mary Witlacil considers whether hope, futurity, and utopian visioning are antithetical to critical theorizing when global capitalism appears as entrenched as a granitic batholith with little hope for an “out” of the climate crisis.","William W.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 56: American Political Thought,,September 18,am,8:00,9:30,Moral Psychology in American Political Thought,"Due in part to the outsized place of The Federalist in efforts to characterize American political thought, the American political tradition is often understood in terms of the hard-headed “science of politics.” On this view, a rights-centered political order can achieve political stability even in the absence of a civic-minded citizenry or enlightened statesmen in government. Instead, it assumes the self-regarding aspects of human nature, among both government officials and the people more broadly, can be channeled and redirected in ways that redound to the benefit of the political association. Though there is something to this account, it is incomplete as an understanding of the moral psychological assumptions that undergird core aspects of American political thought. This panel explores the diverse perspectives on human moral psychology that characterize the views of prominent figures in the American political tradition. As the papers on this panel suggest, some important thinkers assumed humans are both self- and other-regarding, and they offer a view of politics in which education, law, and institutions, among other things, are harnessed to check, direct, and encourage both aspects of human nature in ways that stabilize and improve society. Moreover, there exists considerable nuance in how these thinkers understood the self-interested aspects of human nature. Even those who tended to emphasize the dominant role of self-love in determining human behavior nonetheless provided sophisticated analyses of how calculations of self-interest could be creatively engineered to induce prosocial behavior. The papers on this panel analyze different thinkers’ accounts of human moral psychology and situate them within the respective thinker’s practical political proposals.",Nicholas R.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 8: Political Methodology,,September 18,am,8:00,9:30,Advances in Expert-Coded Data,"In this panel, participants discuss recent advances in the social scientific use of expert-coded data. This topic is both timely and fitting for the conference theme: while an increasing number of important projects involve collecting and analyzing expert-coded data (e.g. Bright Line Watch, the Chapel Hill Expert Survey [CHES], the Electoral Integrity Project, the GLOBSEC Vulnerability Index, the Human Rights Measurement Initiative [HRMI], and the Varieties of Democracy [V-Dem] Project), the theoretical and methodological underpinnings of these endeavors can go unaddressed. Equally importantly, while an extensive amount of research has focused on developing methodologically sound and technically innovative approaches to aggregating expert codings, making the resulting data interpretable and usable to a variety of consumers has drawn relatively less academic focus. This panel engages with these concerns, drawing on the panelists' years of experience with expert coded data: both the chair and the panelists have been deeply involved in the V-Dem Project, while the discussant has been instrumental in both the CHES and HRMI projects.
In her presentation, Brigitte Seim both presents a typology for understanding the advantages and disadvantages of different types of human coders and empirically illustrates the implications of this typology; she also discusses the importance of understanding and accounting for variation in expert quality. Daniel Pemstein takes the panel discussion to the methodological cutting-edge, discussing how to incorporate insights about both expert cognition and institutional change into the measurement of trends in institutions across time. Kyle Marquardt's presentation focuses on the trade-offs involved in maintaining such methodological rigor while also making expert-coded data accessible to a wide audience. Finally, Marina Povitkina provides a capstone for the panel, illustrating how to use expert-coded data to analyze the relationship between natural disasters and democratization.",Jeffrey Staton Emory University,"Ryan Bakker University of Georgia

Full Paper Panel,NA,Theme Panel,"Division 32: Race, Ethnicity, and Politics",September 18,am,8:00,9:30,"Race, Rhetoric, and Representation","Racial and ethnic minorities have historically been underrepresented in the United States’ legislatures. This fact has led academics and pundits alike to argue that the country’s racioethnic minorities would benefit from more co-ethnic representatives, a stance that essentializes the choices of these voters and tends not to differentiate between the ideology and behaviors of the representatives themselves. Taking the heterogeneity of minority electorates and officials seriously, however, means engaging in the process of questioning, deconstructing, and extending seminal theories of race and ethnic politics in the United States. When is descriptive representation relevant in determining vote choice among racioethnic minority voters? How do politicians signal their commitments to their racioethnic group? Are some descriptive representatives preferable to others when it comes to the representation of racial and ethnic minorities' interests and priorities?
This panel brings together five papers that employ novel approaches towards advancing and adding nuance to our understanding of the intersection of race, voting behavior, and elite behavior by focusing on Black voters and politicians. In his analysis of Black voters, Sparrow documents their joint preferences over ideological and descriptive representation, offering a new theoretical perspective on when and why race becomes relevant in the formation of preferences over candidates. Smith adds to this narrative and argues that Black voters are acutely aware of candidate viability and electability in early contests when voters are more likely to be strategic. How, then, do Black candidates respond to voters’ preferences for representatives? Wamble suggests that candidates’ capacity to signal their fitness is limited by innate characteristics. He shows that Black voters perceive female candidates as more committed to prioritizing the group’s interests once in office. Rendleman demonstrates that Black candidates are responsive to the composition of the electorate when deploying racialized rhetoric. Focusing on primaries, her work shows that the self-presentation of candidates is dependent on district and contest characteristics – which has implications for general election behavior and activities once in office. Finally, Stout, Mondragon, and Garcia look beyond the campaign and examine how elected officials’ online appeals to Black voters translate into the introduction of racially focused legislation. They show that racialized messaging is most predictive of Black officials’ legislative activities. Taken together, these papers offer new insights on when race matters to racioethnic minority voters, and the implications that has for the behavior of co-ethnic politicians.",Andra Gillespie Emory University,"Christian R.

Marc Berenson distinguishes between social and institutional trust in his analysis of pathways for reducing corruption in public services, tax collection, law enforcement and the judiciary in Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, drawing on the experience of Estonia, Poland, and Romania. Sergiu Gherghina and Inga Saikkonen turn to clientelism as they study the relationship between clientelistic electoral inducements and partisanship in Romania. Using a conjoint experimental design, they examine the extent to which co-partisanship moderates how voters react to clientelistic targeting. Barbara Junisbai builds on the theme of clientelism and family rule as she explains the divergent fates of strongman presidents who violated the norms of patronage that kept them in power in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. Edward Ngai and Katharin Tai turn to the political uses of public policies that reveal corruption in dictatorships. Using the example of China, they argue that anti-corruption campaigns represent mobilization strategies that spread regime-sanctioned value frames of the ruling regime.

Second, Pan considers the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) on workers’ welfare and domestic politics in Kyrgyzstan, where there are extensive mining operations. Third, Sklar examines the domestic forces driving China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), particularly competition at the provincial level.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 1: Political Thought and Philosophy,,September 18,am,10:00,11:30,Corporal Politics of Torture and Incarceration or the Corporality of Carcerality,"Much of the literature on incarceration and torture regards these practices as destructive and repressive. Prisons, torture facilities, and detention centers, however, include facets of productive power as well. They make and unmake people. The presentations in this panel ask to expand political theory’s understanding of these sites by investigating what subjects they produce, and, more specifically, how these production processes use people’s bodies. Analyzing the corporal politics of carcerality, each of these presentations studies a different practice of subject formation. Anna Terwiel looks at incarcerated people’s hunger strikes in South Africa to question abolitionist critiques of modern medicine. Shai Gortler analyzes torture practices in Israel-Palestine to expound their use as a political technology. Archana Kaku studies how Guantánamo Bay Naval Base and privately-owned migrant detention centers in the US weaponize the imprisoned body. Lastly, Shokoufeh Sakhi researches Iranian prisons, and builds on her own experiences within them, to flesh out the dialectics between eradicating incarcerated people’s relations and offering them the sovereign’s meanings instead. Together, these analyses look at prisons and torture facilities to identify the corporal dimensions through which they attempt to form subjectivities but also, through embodied resistance, of how subjects make themselves. This means— for some of the authors—paying attention to how carceral sites build on incarcerated and/or tortured people’s actions to serve their interests (Sakhi, Gortler); or to understand how larger structures such as law or medicine are affected by and make use of corporal carcerality (Terwiel, Kaku). Thus, torture (for Kaku and Gortler) and incarceration (for Terwiel and Sakhi), while distinct from one another, share a corporal dimension that not only destroys but builds as well. The result is an invitation to political theorists to consider even those embodied practices theorized as the most repressive one can imagine, as nevertheless operating within a wider frame that includes productive subject formation.",Andrew Dilts Loyola Marymount University,Delio Vasquez American University,"The Law of Detention: Guantánamo, Private Detention Centers, and Border Violence - Archana Kaku

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 12: Comparative Politics of Developing Countries,,September 18,am,10:00,11:30,"Surveillance, Repression, and Technology in Autocratic Politics","Surveillance and repression are fundamental strategies through which autocracies maintain control over society. In recent years, digital technologies have given states powerful new tools for conducting these activities, leading to an emerging line of research examining this new “digital authoritarianism” in broad strokes. Yet this burgeoning set of research still leaves many questions unresolved about the implications of digital tools for autocratic politics and about how the new dynamics of surveillance and repression differ from those in past dictatorships. This panel seeks to both examine the contemporary politics of digital surveillance under autocratic rule and to put the connections between surveillance, repression, and technology under autocratic rule in comparative and historical perspective.
Two papers directly study the politics of digital surveillance in contemporary autocracies. Xu considers the relationship between state surveillance and the degree of violent repression in China, arguing that the country’s fearsome digital surveillance state has created an “upward spiral” allowing social control with relatively minimal levels of violence. Handlin examines how digitally empowered secret police have shaped the dynamics of electoral authoritarianism in Venezuela, arguing that extensive surveillance has been double-edged: Heavy surveillance has given the regime unique insight into the strategies and internal dynamics of the opposition, but has also increased the tendency of the population to conceal their political preferences, making elections more unpredictable and dangerous to the regime. Two other papers provide comparative and historical perspectives on surveillance, repression, and technology. Esberg studies the use of artistic blacklisting by autocracies to manage the social impact of the film industry in the pre-digital age, examining Argentine’s dictatorship during the 1970s and the long-run effects of this form of repression. Thomson examines the fundamental issue of how dictatorships can both create secret policing institutions with great capacity for surveillance and repression while also preventing those institutions from turning those capabilities on regime leaders themselves, studying the nature and evolution of secret police in six dictatorships of East-Central Europe in the Cold War era.",Dan Slater University of Michigan,Alexandra Arons Siegel University of Coloardo Boulder,"Coercive Campaigning: Digital Surveillance and Electoral Autocracy in Venezuela - Samuel Handlin, Swarthmore College

Although the role of diplomats diminished during the Trump administration, their role has regained emphasis in the current Biden administration. This panel will examine this re-emphasis on diplomacy as a solution to conflict and the implications of that shift in strategy for democratic institutions and international cooperation for the United States and other states. To what degree can ambassadors help the world “reconnect” after a period of populism, democratic backsliding, and pandemic disruption? In answering that question, Ahmed and Slaski study how diplomats affect exports across different sectors and the mechanisms through which those differences emerge. Poulsen investigates how the UK has utilized its diplomatic corps to promote corporate interests, particularly during expropriation disputes. St. John examines how participation by diplomats in investor-state dispute settlement mechanisms has been affected by the pandemic. Thrall and Malis explore the role of diplomats as lobbyists, particularly whether their activities are driven by connections or knowledge. Collectively, the papers examine the role of ambassadors as promoters of cooperation on both security and commerce and if so, whether the type of partner matters.

Global governance structures are increasingly described as highly complex, fragmented, and polycentric. In many issue areas, the creation, design, and effectiveness of different types of global governance institutions are fundamentally shaped by how these institutions interact with other institutions operating in their domain. Despite this increasing importance of inter-institutional interactions for the life of individual global governance institutions, we still know little about how different types of institutions are interconnected and cooperate and what factors help to explain variation in patterns of inter-institutional collaboration. The few existing studies either focus on particular issue areas or isolated pairs of organizations. The papers on this panel address this research gap. Using new data and innovative methods, they map inter-institutional collaboration in global governance in diverse issue areas of world politics and develop new theoretical arguments to explain the occurrence and consequences of collaboration among global governance institutions.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 2: Foundations of Political Theory,,September 18,am,10:00,11:30,Activating the Canon across Disciplinary Divides,"The academy and the liberal arts are currently facing a now-familiar set of challenges in public discourse and critique: what is the value in the modern, specialized, world of a well-rounded university education? should ‘canons’ be abandoned, preserved, or refashioned? are universities sites of privilege, out of touch with the needs and realities of the contemporary world? This challenge has most recently come to a head in an exchange between Roosevelt Montás, author of Rescuing Socrates: How the Great Books Changed my Life (2021), and Louis Menand’s dismissive response in The New Yorker: “What’s so Great about Great Books Courses?” (Dec 20 2021). Menand launches an attack against what he perceives to be an exclusivist defense of canonical education: humanists “should be defending their role in the knowledge business, not standing aloof in the name of unspecified and unspecifiable higher things. They need to connect with disciplines outside the humanities, to get out of their silos . . . The idea that students develop a greater capacity for empathy by reading books in literature classes about people who never existed than they can by taking classes in fields that study actual human behavior does not make a lot of sense.”
Menand’s critique is, however, grounded in a false premise. Humanists and readers of ‘great books’ of course lament the fragmentation of the disciplines in the academy—a condition that is rapidly accelerating, and a long way from the worlds in which most thinkers and writers lived and worked themselves, often studying and writing economics, science, theology, literature, philosophy simultaneously. This panel illuminates a variety of connections between modern canonical thinkers in the history of political thought (Rousseau, Tocqueville, Nietzsche), to thinkers from other disciplines (F.A. Hayek, Georges Sorel, Susanne Langer, and Jacob Burckhardt) in order to demonstrate that the ‘canon’ remained, and remains, very much alive across disciplines, despite the surface fragmentation of thinking in the modern university. Contra Menand, to acknowledge the connections of these canonical thinkers to works in economics, social and cultural theory, political activism, aesthetics, and history is not, however, to make these texts into ‘deliverables’ for the “knowledge business”; nor does it suggest that the only use value of a canonical work exists in its exchange value for more practical or non-theoretical purposes. Rather, it is evident that these ‘canonical’ thinkers have always remained relevant to, and present in, seemingly divided disciplines—defying, rather than perpetuating, the fragmentation of thinking, and opening up new ways of thinking and seeing through engagement with ‘canonical’ texts.
Emma Planinc (Notre Dame) serves as chair, and will present a paper connecting Jean-Jacques Rousseau to the modern aesthetic philosophy of Susanne Langer, offering a new account of textual interpretation for political philosophy grounded in artistic creation. Alicia Steinmetz (Yale and IAS) puts Friedrich Nietzsche in conversation with the Swiss art historian and cultural critic Jacob Burckhardt to illuminate the tension between politics and culture, contributing to an analysis of how ‘action’ is understood and constituted. Christine Henderson and Chandran Kukathas (SMU) show that F.A. Hayek’s The Road to Serfdom rests on Tocquevillian foundations, which opens up novel ways of thinking about both Hayek and Alexis de Tocqueville’s conceptions of freedom and unfreedom. Gianna Englert and Richard Boyd challenge the view that Tocqueville was “lost to the French” through showing that his work (especially his Ancien Régime) was integral to the thinking of Georges Sorel, offering new ways to think about both Sorel’s claims about political revolution, and Tocqueville’s own “strange” liberalism. Michelle Schwarze (University of Wisconsin-Madision) and Rita Koganzon (University of Virginia) will serve as co-discussants.",Emma Planinc University of Notre Dame,"Michelle Schwarze University of Wisconsin, Madison

With a special emphasis on twentieth century Jewish thought and the way that radical movements both appropriated and altered traditional understands of Jewish law (Halachah), the papers on this panel explore how a concept of law that appears to be so singular and determinate is actually productive of infinite varieties, radical aporias and, at times, returns to the concepts of law that anchor the Jewish theological tradition.",James R.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 2: Foundations of Political Theory,,September 18,am,10:00,11:30,Political Theory and the Foundations of Economic Policy,"Political theory and political economy have been sister sciences for as long as the latter has existed. But in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, the younger discipline, now known as economics, has taken a clear priority over the older, assuming a position as both the methodological foundation for the empirical social sciences, and as the epistemic basis for public policy. The papers in this panel seek to re-evaluate the normative implications of modern economic theory. Each paper uncovers the moral and political work done by purportedly empirical theories and critically examines how these theories shape policy making and the public imagination. In doing so, they also draw attention to the critical role of political theory in rethinking, restructuring and reconnecting the relationship between economic ideas and economic policy.
As economics has achieved preeminence as the theoretical framework for the production of public policy, the normative assumptions of economic theories have become important both for downstream policies and the construction of normative theory. Leah Downey’s paper “Against Potential Output” examines how potential output, a purportedly neutral metric of economic planning, serves to constrain policy makers and restricts the authority of democratic legislative institutions themselves. Rather than being a useful tool for maximizing output over time, potential output functions as a tool for preservation, enabling macroeconomic policymakers to make future economies look roughly like today’s, thereby constraining the scope of action for democratic institutions. The paper presents a way forward for applied democratic theory, and highlights the role that the unexamined economic foundations of policy planning play in driving a wedge between democratic theory and practice.
In a similar vein, Zeynep Pamuk’s contribution, “Rationalizing Racism and Sexism: The Invention of Statistical Discrimination,” uncovers the serious consequences that economic theories can have for normative debates. Her paper shows how economic theories that fail empirically or predictively can nevertheless have long afterlives in structuring the possibilities for normative discussion. In the case of economic theories of racial and gender discrimination, the paper finds that empirically suspect theories of “rational” discrimination have nevertheless persisted as “moral fables” that have helped to shape both public opinion and scholarly work on discrimination since the 1970s. The normative lesson of statistical discrimination models has turned out to be one that allows complacence about discrimination, while misdirecting attention away from the social and economic factors that truly matter for explaining the persistence of discrimination in the labor market.
Joy Wang’s paper “Sponges, rockets, engines: metaphors of dual economy and the postcolonial politics of growth” takes up the normative displacements and political terrains generated by models of “the economy” in the context of postcolonial development. Through a reconstruction of the central metaphors of the economic thought of W. Arthur Lewis, a pan-African political thinker and foundational figure in modern development economics, her paper analyzes how Lewis’ account of the structural causes of postcolonial poverty constructed economic growth as a political imperative for postcolonial self-determination. The importance Lewis accorded to the transcendence of labor abundance imposed a temporality of development in which economic modernization took priority over questions of democratic planning or fair distribution. Critical examination of postcolonial dreams of development not only enriches our understanding of the problem-spaces of postcolonial self-determination, but also renders its contemporary traces more available for popular contestation.
The theme of economic theory as fable or metaphor is also taken up by Jacob Abolafia’s paper on “The Myth of Singapore.” Since the 1980s, Singapore has served as a sort of cipher for economic growth based on a principle of marketization. Despite the fact that political economists and historians agree in classifying Singapore as a triumph of state capitalism rather than an example of the success of the “free market”, the last decade has witnessed an increase in appeals to the example of Singapore to justify market-centered economic policy by governing parties in the UK, Israel, and Russia, among others. Drawing on recent work on the political theory of myths, the paper argues that this appeal to an imagined “Singapore” should be understood as a political-economic “policy myth” meant to bridge the gap between populist politics and earlier “Thatcherite” policy prescriptions. The category of policy myth should take its place alongside concepts like “policy diffusion” and “policy scripts” as a basis for understanding how political and economic theories interact beyond national borders.",Stefan Eich Georgetown University,Stefan Eich Georgetown University,"Against Potential Output - Leah Downey, Cambridge University

There may be systemic biases and political factors that impact the accuracy of data presented. Further dilemmas scholars may run into could include ethical considerations in relation to who/what/where the dataset is observing, decisions between when to construct versus re-construct data, and how to do so. We discuss questions of who is being counted as what and the implications of amplifying existing coding conventions for path dependency in conflict studies. This timely panel brings together projects that tackle the challenges and solutions of conflict dataset (re) construction.

This panel makes several new theoretical and empirical contributions to that research literature. Panel members Strach, Pérez-Chiqués, and Zuber offer a paper that studies intermediaries in social services provision that might also experience administrative burdens. Their contribution demonstrates that these burdens have implications not only for the ultimate recipients of government services but also for the providers who try to work with those recipients as well, suggesting new theoretical terrain organized around policy implementers’ perspectives. Barnes’s study engages a highly salient contemporary issue, namely, the degree to which people attempting to use public services and programs amidst the COVID-19 pandemic have found experiences to be burdensome. The paper assesses how and why these burdens persist even in cases where public policymakers have attempted to reduce administrative burdens to make these program benefits more accessible. Finally, Manna’s paper presents an effort to expand the literature’s normative discussion about administrative burden, arguing that although most research focuses on normatively undesirable burdens, there are other administrative burdens that might be normatively desirable and uphold key democratic values. The paper offers a unifying framework that engages this full range of administrative burdens and draws out implications for research and policy implementation. In all, the panel musters a range of new evidence and theorizing to better understand how people and policymakers experience administrative burden, and also broader effects on policy processes and democratic values in the United States. Finally, the papers all engage in some way the overall conference theme of “Rethink, Restructure, and Reconnect.”",Sanghee Park Boise State University,Susan L.

Yet explanations continue to center on national-level processes that tell little of the particular urban political dynamics that shape a variety of city-level outcomes such as spatial growth, social assistance, social policy reform or inequality. In this panel, a group of scholars conducts comparisons across small and large numbers of Latin American cities in order to understand the political dynamics of urban development and wellbeing. The papers underscore the importance of city-specific political dynamics and linkages between local and national political processes. In this regard, power relations between alternative local majors and councils, the interdependence between local economic elites and working classes, the interaction between grassroots social movements and local bureaucrats, and the linkages between electoral rules and party coalitions explain variation in social assistance, income inequality, urban growth, and social policy reform success. This panel addresses the 2022 Congress theme “Rethink, Restructure, and Reconnect” by featuring innovative research that seeks to understand from a locally situated perspective the possibilities of reaching more inclusionary, supportive, and successful cities in the most unequal region of the world.

Past RCV panels have compared the emergent US experience with that of other countries (e.g., Australia and Ireland), or with seemingly comparable reform alternatives (e.g., two-round runoff). RCV is no longer an 'emergent' reform; 66 jurisdictions now have some version on the books. Moreover, these versions are substantially different from what exist in other countries -- especially with respect to party nominations, but also the ways in which they allocate seats. Broadly, this panel looks at American 'RCV experience' against the backdrop of an increasingly difficult voting-rights environment.

However, the harms and disruptions associated with these events are embedded in complex institutional and socioeconomic environments, and these events can trigger their own sociopolitical dynamics. Responses to extreme weather events come in different forms — for example post-disaster relief or efforts to increase the resilience of communities through adaptation in place and relocation efforts — and vary from location to location with different implications for equity. In many communities affected by coastal flooding or wildfires, individual homeowners must make difficult decisions about how to respond. Personal behaviors and policy preferences are shaped by individuals’ personal experiences, how political actors and the media attribute the causes of events, and the distributional impacts and perceived personal benefits associated with different types of responses.
Using targeted surveys of vulnerable and impacted communities, qualitative interviews, and historical data, the papers in this panel illuminate different aspects of the sociopolitical dynamics surrounding extreme weather events, adaptation policy and political behavior. Green uses survey data and interviews to investigate the relationship between power outage experience, political behavior and adaptive choices, focusing on the Texas blackouts of 2021. Andrews, Constantino and Cooperman use experimental data from a targeted survey in areas that had recent or ongoing wildfires to study the relationship between attribution frames, fire proximity, policy preferences and collective action. Kijewski-Correa, Javeline, Kakenmaster, and Chesler survey North Carolina coastal homeowners to understand the motivations and barriers to voluntary investments in property-level adaptation measures.

Full Paper Panel,NA,"Division 41: Politics, Literature, and Film",,September 18,am,10:00,11:30,"The Politics of Time and Resistance: Ruptures, Time-Lags and Decelerations","This panel will address the politics of time and resistance. Echoing the 2022 APSA theme “Rethink, Restructure, and Reconnect,” it explores how alternative temporalities might provide openings for rethinking and restructuring dominant temporal practices and imaginaries that subjects in contemporary capitalist democracies find themselves in. As stated in the conference theme, the effects of today’s global crises should prompt political theory to analyze and explore whether and how work, including the work of political theorists, can and should be transformed. The panel does that by analyzing practices of exposing the contingency of time’s reigning definitions, and by promoting a variety of times that both intervenes in the habitual times of people’s daily routines and provides them the opportunity to live well, as equals, in different modes of time. In doing that, it also seeks to explore and articulate the political value of unproductive action, inaction, and refusal in terms of interruptions and transformations of the usual ways political theory, and more generally society, values political action as productive and devalues inaction as unproductive.
Time is politically significant because it is a scarce resource in struggles for power and distributive justice, but also, and more broadly, because it is a key medium for organizing and regulating the social world in relation to human life. Time is a medium constitutive of what we sense as the common world that we share, as it defines what is given as the present, the way such present continues or breaks with the past, and how it makes possible or impossible specific futures. Practices of organizing life and society, then, are always also temporal practices. While we might experience time, through its an-aesthetic qualities, as a neutral background-condition of our political lives, as a medium, however, it enters deeply into the lives of people, as habits of using, spending and being in time they presume to be normal. What counts as time, how it is defined or measured, or why it’s important in our lives, always comes wrapped in media-structured perceptions of the world, and against the background of lived experiences of what seems possible or impossible to do in time, which is structured, also, by the given rhythms of labor and leisure. Indeed, today we still live in metronomic societies where clock time largely defines the time of institutions and the rhythms of everyday live. The resulting culture of speed produces forms of overstrain, (self-)exploitation, and other debilitating effects on a range of activities that cannot be so measured or rationed in time. But these effects are unevenly distributed. While some suffer from the blurring of the line between leisure and work, others suffer from being forced to enable this temporality and of mitigating its negative effects. A fundamental problem underlying this is unequal access to different modalities of time and, at the same time, a narrowed conception of what modalities of time are even possible and valuable.
A key question for the panel, then, is what possibilities are conceivable for articulating and realizing radically alternative organizations of action and utility in time, given the rationalized expectations of self-discipline and productivity that the contemporary flow of ordinary temporality entails. What, in other words, would a politics look like that pushes beyond our familiar time horizons, toward a politics of many rhythms, open to, chosen by, and enjoyed by all citizens? The panel addresses these questions by exploring ways to de-naturalize, pluralize and democratize lived time. To this end, it analyzes how forms of inactivity, purposelessness, unproductive time, etc. – forms of entering the time of aesthetic or an-aesthetic experience – can generate critical potential for resisting and countering the prevailing ideology that measurable productivity and growth are the purpose of human organization. The panel draws on a diversity of discourses and examples, from Rousseau’s and Rancière’s meditations on the value of reverie to our practices of freedom to the gig economy and how it connects sleep and work to maintain an ideology of productivity, from the concept of nocturnal advent as an alternative time for living to an account of why timing matters to social justice.",Davide Panagia UCLA,Bonnie Honig Brown University,"Social Justice and Timing - Elizabeth F.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 45: Human Rights,,September 18,am,10:00,11:30,Populism and Human Rights in Comparative Perspective,"In the turbulent generation of the 21st century, insecurity and neo-liberal globalization have been met with the rise of populism worldwide: mass mobilization contesting the status of economic, political, and cultural elites in the name of a national demos. Populism promises to improve the terms of membership in a society by limiting its scope to “the (real) people,” privileging plebiscitary democracy over the rule of law, and disrupting institutional or Constitutional checks and balances on popular will. Hence populism tends to be inimical to minority rights that challenge the dominance of the demos and its charismatic leaders. As liberal democracy cannot deliver social and economic citizenship, populist movements attempt to substitute cultural citizenship for the international regime of legal rights. The hegemonic construction of national identity in reference to an imagined past is usually exclusionary and grounded in a revival of patriarchy. This panel compares three regions with scholars from each and a focus on diversity and gender.
1)Populism and political economy in Central Europe
Oldrich Krpec and Carol Wise
Our goal is to explore and explain the contemporary illiberal turn in Central Europe. Focusing on the cases of Hungary, Poland and Czechia, populism is understandable as an attempt to solve the problem of independent national state formation and economic modernization. Superficial acceptance of the reform and policy package of liberal democracy and neoliberal economy was the result of the rush to the West after the collapse of Soviet bloc and the conditionality of EU and NATO membership. The social rights limitations of the dependent market economy model which become apparent after the global financial crisis of 2008 have fostered an ongoing search for alternatives. Both liberal democracy in its progressive and cosmopolitan form and neoliberal economy--another form of economic dominance by the West--are questioned by the “authentic representatives” of the nation, mobilizing the public in order to avert the dissolution of the nation within the European arena. While targeting international and national elites, populist policies impact those who were supported or even privileged by liberalism–minorities and migrants, and also civil society, media or academia.
2)Mexico: Populism vs. feminism
Kathleen Bruhn
This paper will examine the AMLO administration's troubled relationship with feminist organizations and women's rights, as a particular puzzle because of his leftist trajectory. I will contrast the gains in women's political representation (cabinet, governorships, and legislature) with the negative reaction to women's movements and protests demanding attention to issues like femicides. I will argue that the Manichean nature of the populist discourse makes it difficult for AMLO to concede legitimacy to movements and organizations that criticize his handling of women's rights.
3)India: Democratic Backsliding and Administration
Satyajit Singh
The overwhelming mandate for the NDA government in 2014, and a spectacular reaffirmation in 2019 for the Hindu fundamentalist BJP marks a watershed in Indian politics. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ability from 2014 onwards to control both the BJP and the government; relentlessly attack and buy out opposition; use statutory institutions as an arm of the government and party; and weaponize society against minorities, civil society, the press and intellectuals; has also had an impact on public administration and good governance. Hard fought democratic traditions and norms, participatory governance methods and accountable institutions are under attack. This paper looks at the unfolding of this populist authoritarian stage in Indian politics, with specific cases of protests and rights at risk.
4)Populism and gender backlash in Brazil
Vitoria Moreira Sacramento
In the last 10 years, Brazil has gone from a relatively stable and progressive democracy to an emblematic case of the global rise of right-wing populism and of gender backlash. Since the 2013 mobilizations that spread across the country demanding change in “politics as usual,” the country has seen the steep rise of right-wing populism that now threaten Brazilian democracy and human rights. In 2018, with the election of far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro, the country consolidated the influence of a transnational populist movement that targets reproductive and SOGI (sexual orientation and gender identity) rights under the banner of combating “gender ideology”. In my contribution, I will trace the origins of the current backlash against reproductive and SOGI rights in Brazil and explain how it fits within Bolsonaro’s populist project. I will assess the impacts of this backlash on the state of human rights and consider responses to the phenomenon and its policy implications.",Alison Brysk UCSB,,"Populism and Political Economy in Central Europe - Oldrich Krpec, Masaryk University; Carol Wise, University of Southern California

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 46: Qualitative Methods,,September 18,am,10:00,11:30,"Reconnecting Regions, Contexts & Concepts: Comparative Area Studies (CAS) Redux","The panel builds in significant ways on the arguments and agendas outlined in the volume Comparative Area Studies: Methodological Rationales and Empirical Applications (Oxford University Press, 2018), coedited by Ariel Ahram, Patrick Köllner and Rudra Sil. Comparative area studies (CAS) represents an epistemologically distinct form of small-N comparative analysis, marked by a self-conscious effort by scholars to: (i) balance deep sensitivity to context in the locales being examined with the extension of small-N qualitative comparison to explore complex processes unfolding across multiple regions; and (ii) engage ongoing research and scholarly discourse in two or more area studies communities against the backdrop of more general concepts and theoretical debates within a social science discipline. CAS is more context-focused and more willing to engage with the multi-discplinary output of area studies communities than is typical in standard models of the comparative method (such as Millean small-N comparison). Yet, by disembedding and translating questions and concepts from the intellectual traditions developed in any one area studies community, CAS facilitates insights that are neither limited to, nor overgeneralizing from, one particular geographic region.
CAS offers both analytic and dialogical benefits. The analytic benefits concern leveraging contextualized comparison across regions to generate novel “middle range” generalizations about mechanisms and processes that are sometimes missed because the relevant observations are embedded in discrete bodies of qualitative research siloed in separate area studies communities. The dialogical benefits stress the importance of sustained engagement with, and translation and aggregation of, concepts and theoretical discourses using a common analytic lens that illuminates the connections to evolving debates in the Political Science discipline writ large. CAS thus expands the channels of fruitful problem-focused connections both “horizontally” (across separate area studies communities that often grapple with similar issues albeit using different vocabularies) and “vertically” (between various area studies communities and generalists in political science).
Following the publication of the volume, it became evident that several researchers in the North America, Europe and elsewhere who identified their research with the CAS agenda and were open to bringing their separate scholarly efforts under its umbrella. Some of these scholars were most excited by the possibilities for new connections and collaborations, others wanted to develop new methodological rationales and research applications for CAS, and still others raised practical questions about the resources and institutional support for CAS. This was evident, for example, in the lead Symposium published in the Newsletter of the Qualitative & Multi-Method Research section (vol. 17-18, issue 1, 2020), which included constructive critiques offered by those who wished to elaborate on CAS and push its agenda further.
In response, the editors of the 2018 CAS volume have comissioned a set of new papers, most of which are being written by scholars who were not featured in the first volume but who embrace the possibilities for new ways to renew and reconnect area studies communities to each other and to the discipline of Political Science. The objective this time is not only to explore new applications but also probe more deeply the sorts of conceptual innovations, analytic templates and institutional connections that help to differentiate CAS and make it more fruitful. The broader goal, however, remains: to enable like-minded scholars to confidently carry out context-sensitive cross-regional research that leverages insights from different world regions without being tethered to a single method or confined to debates within a single area studies community. This panel, comprised of nine political scientists representing eight institutions situated in three countries, is part of this effort. It will be chaired by Rudra Sil (University of Pennsylvania), one of the editors of the 2018 volume. It will include two discussants, Amel Ahmed (University of Massachusetts) and Roselyn Hsueh (Temple University). The four papers, described in the individual abstracts, are:

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 53: African Politics,,September 18,am,10:00,11:30,"Legislatures in Africa: Responsiveness, Representation, and Legislating","Legislatures are indispensable components of modern democracies. Their members are charged with formal functions of critical importance including lawmaking, executive oversight, constituency representation, and constituency service. Ideally, legislators collectively put effort in performing all these functions. Yet, in the African context the role of legislatures has been particularly questioned. Older literature in the field portrays legislatures as weak institutions in the shadow of a powerful executive branch, whose impact is negligible. On the other hand, a more recent wave of studies indicates that African legislatures can have a much more integral and dynamic role in governing than previously thought.
In this panel, we will discuss what determines the degree of responsiveness and representation of local issues exhibited in legislatures in the continent. The papers in the panel follow diverse approaches in exploring these issues. With some of the papers focusing on a single country and others following a cross-country approach, our discussion will include Ghana, South Africa, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Egypt, Tunisia, and in addition Turkey. The panel will focus on mechanisms that encourage legislators to be responsive and represent their constituents in different contexts. These include institutional setups that offer clear incentives for the cultivation of a personal vote, like first past the post systems, setups in which such incentives are much less pronounced, like closed list proportional systems, and setups in which electoral pressures are much decreased, like in single party authoritarian regimes. The panel will make important contributions to the literature on African politics by questioning under what conditions legislatures in the continent become more responsive towards the citizens, represent them more efficiently, and legislate accordingly.",Marwa Shalaby University of Wisconsin-Madison,Yonatan L.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 59: Education Politics and Policy,,September 18,am,10:00,11:30,An Evolving Education Governance Landscape,"Education, perhaps more so than any other policy area, has been shaped by local governance. However, in the past few decades, evolving state and federal roles in education have clashed with local control of schools resulting in changes to prevailing modes of education governance. This panel brings together four papers to offer a multifaceted view of contemporary educational governance, each devoting particular attention to prevailing local control of schools. These papers employ a variety of methodological approaches to better understand how the historical tug-of-war between centralization and decentralization of educational decision-making shapes today’s education governance landscape.
In the first paper,Cameron Arnzenand David Houston explore how public opinion regarding the distribution of education decision-making authority has shifted, specifically during the last ten years as federal influence has peaked. Recently, debates about Critical Race Theory in schools and public health protocols during a global pandemic have buffeted education governance. Using a novel survey experiment, the authors explore under what conditions preferences of decentralization of education decision-making might change.
The second paper from Aliyah Mcilwan and Sarah Reckhow engages a different aspect of the local control debate as the authors examine how school choice policies shape voter participation among parents and guardians of school aged children in school board elections and school bond elections. By matching student level data to the Michigan voter file and leveraging variation across Michigan school districts, they compare voter participation among parents/guardians of school children who participate in school choice programs and school children who attend school in the local district of residence.
In the third paper, Sara Sands examines whether a school district’s decision to implement a teacher empowerment program from the bottom-up or the top-down impacts the results attained, including student achievement and school quality outcomes, and the experiences of stakeholders. Using New York City’s Teacher Career Pathways program as a case study, she explores whether district influence in program implementation supported or hindered the cultivation of teachers as leaders in their school communities.
In the final paper, Melissa Arnold Lyon, Joshua Bleiberg, and Beth Schueler ask whether state takeover, one particular form of political centralization, increases school funding equity, and whether or not the alignment with other centralization policies compounds the effects. The authors utilize a novel data set to explore the financial impacts of state takeovers of schools fiscal health and resource equity. They conclude that takeovers result in increased local revenues, but revenues are devoted to paying off school debts rather than ameliorating resource gaps. Finally, the alignment of takeovers with other centralization efforts strengthens these effects.
In the midst of evolving federal and state roles in education governance, these papers offer insight into how the public perceives and shapes educational decision-making along both vertical and horizontal dimensions of centralization and decentralization. Further, the papers offer insight into how recent movement along these dimensions affects schools’ academic outcomes, financial health, and equity goals.

The threat of a public health disaster became apparent to the governments in all countries at about the same time, even though eventual peaks of infection occurred at different times in different countries. Public health policies were the primary method to reduce the spread of infection both before and after the vaccine development, albeit of greater importance during the Non-Medical Intervention period of the year 2020. The public health solutions to the crisis were first limited to things political, and later supplemented to a great extent when more virulent variants of the virus some into play. The government incumbents have put in place protective public health policies ranging from instituting lockdowns to requiring the wearing of face covers. Protective policies were socially and economically costly, while their benefits were hard to ascertain in advance, and were to be observed more in the long run if at all. The pandemic thus presented the political incumbents worldwide with a choice situation in terms of what if any public health measures they would enact. This panel asks and answers questions about the effects of political institutions and the condition of party systems at national and subnational levels on the strategic behavior of politicians in public health policy making.","Olga V.

Full Paper Panel,NA,Theme Panel,Division 3: Normative Theory,September 18,am,10:00,11:30,Theorizing Structural Injustice and Responses to It,"In recent years, it has become increasingly common for problems to be described as “structural.” Academics, journalists, politicians, and activists alike speak of “structural racism,” “structural inequality,” “structural violence,” and “structural injustice.” In 2020, the confluence of the COVID-19 pandemic, which laid bare so many underlying disparities, and the large-scale protests in response to the police killing of George Floyd, which called attention to the pervasiveness of state violence against Black people in the US, forced many—some for the first time—to confront the structural nature of problems they may have previously seen as isolated misfortunes. This recent trend, made possible by the work of activists and existing scholarship, provides political theory with a unique opportunity to contribute to the conceptualization of both the problem of structural injustice in its current instantiations and possible responses.
This panel attempts to take up this opportunity by addressing a number of interrelated questions. What makes a particular injustice structural? What understandings of action and power underlie theories of structural injustice? Is agency possible according to a structural model? What is the relationship between individuals and the structures they inhabit? What would it mean to take responsibility for structural injustice? What obstacles exist to addressing structural injustice? What strategies do activists use to overcome those obstacles? Is structural transformation possible?
Building upon the work of feminist, anti-racist, and anti-colonial thought, the papers in this panel, contributed by both senior and junior scholars, demonstrate the possibilities for political theory to combine rigorous theorization of highly abstract concepts with discussions of concrete contemporary problems. Clarissa Hayward’s paper “Power: A Structural View” examines structural power relations and the challenges involved in attempting to change them, using race relations in the United States as an emblematic case. Mara Marin, in her paper “How to Think of Action as Structural,” considers the “socially structured” character of political action and the centrality of publicity and uncertainty to an account of structural change. Anjali Mohan’s paper “Structural Proximity” asks how conceiving of individuals’ relations to injustice in terms of what she calls “structural proximity” may affect how we respond to it, using examples such as the global COVID-19 pandemic, police killings in the United States, and human rights abuse in Burma/Myanmar. Jennifer Rubenstein, in her paper “Emergency Politics as a Strategy for Addressing Historic and Structural Injustice Against African-Americans,” explores how anti-racist activists, including Ida B. Wells, William Lloyd Garrison, Martin Luther King, and the Movement for Black Lives, have deployed, to varying extents, both emergency politics and structural understandings of racism in their advocacy. Together, these papers, and contributions from the panel’s chair Juliet Hooker and discussant Catherine Lu, will undoubtedly generate a lively and productive discussion regarding the profound structural dimensions of injustice and the challenges and tensions that arise in attempts to respond to it.",Juliet Hooker Brown University,Catherine Lu McGill University,"Power: A Structural View - Clarissa Rile Hayward, Washington University in St. Louis

This panel engages with the need to theorize and measure the impacts of platforms on governance and governments and explores existing strategies from across the political science literature to begin this work. Online services like WhatsApp, Twitter, and Google search have, for many, become integral to everyday life. Correspondingly, the companies that provide these services have become ubiquitous. These multinational platform companies are, among other things, essential communication infrastructures, arbiters of freedom of expression, and distributors of information. Platform companies are governors. At the same time, they are subjects of governance, targeted by states, NGOs, and intergovernmental organizations. Such governance efforts include restricting the collection of data about users (e.g. EU’s GDPR, the Global Network Initiative), limiting applications of artificial intelligence (e.g. banning facial recognition in law enforcement), and challenging the concentration of market power in a small number of organizations (e.g. US antitrust suits). Perspectives in political science regarding functional and hybrid governance, algorithmic governance, transnational corporate governance, the role of policy networks, and democratic theory have much to contribute to this emerging area of research and policy.",Peter John Loewen University of Toronto,"Wendy H.

Virtual Full Paper Panel,NA,Division 2: Foundations of Political Theory,,September 18,am,10:00,11:30,"Dissent, Obedience and Resistance: Early Modern Theories of Political Obligation (Virtual Session)","Contemporary political discourse, particularly surrounding the global response to COVID-19, has been marked by debate about the obligatory force of political decrees. From mask mandates to newly increased restrictions on movement, novel forms of political regulations have tested the boundaries of coercible authority. As a result, civil disobedience is on the rise, and there is popular interest in delineating the extent and shape of individuals’ obligations both to fellow citizens and to the law. These conditions are not so different from those of early modern Europe, where debates raged about what obliges citizens to follow political decrees, and how this obligation is morally justified.
As today, the early modern period was marked by an interest in describing how political directives rise to the level of moral obligation on the part of the subject. Various thinkers, including Suarez, James I, Descartes, Hobbes, and Rousseau, offer accounts of the conditions under which human actions can be legitimately coerced by the commands of the sovereign. These theories variously ground political obligation in either the authority of the lawgiver, the justificatory force of the content of a given law, the binding effect of explicit consent, or the rationality of self-preservation offered by the social contract. In the early modern period, traditional theories of political obligation, based on the good of the commonwealth, gave way to modern theories, which ground political obligation both in consent and in the social contract’s promise of self-preservation.
This panel examines how various early modern political theorists have justified or explained the duty to obey political directives. A first paper examines the question of whether—and, if so, how—membership in an international community creates obligations for both states and their citizens. What if international obligations come into conflict with national-level societal obligations? In their natural law formulations of the issues of just war, Vitoria, Suarez, and Las Casas provide answers that contemporary debates would do well to engage with. A second paper examines the use of political oaths as a popular early modern mechanism for securing explicit consent to political authority. It argues that the Oath of Allegiance controversy at the turn of the seventeenth century modernized this mechanism of obligation in important respects. A third paper investigates the notorious German jurist Carl Schmitt’s reliance on early modern philosophers Thomas Hobbes and René Descartes. Schmitt’s influential, illiberal theory of democracy asserts that the state obliges its citizens only insofar as the state protects their way of life. As the author argues, Schmitt’s argument relies on his attempt to reconcile Hobbesian and Cartesian theories of epistemic justification. Finally, a fourth paper explores how political obligation is generated from the state of nature. It particularly looks at how Hobbes and Rousseau treat the state of nature as a stage that is superseded when the political state is created. The supersession is a way for the normative bases of the state of nature to be collected into a single authority that can create political obligations. The paper argues that this supersession is not an intrinsic part of social contract theory.
In examining several different approaches to the problem of political obligation, these papers explore the ways in which modern theories of obedience and political obligation have emerged from the early modern period. This panel thus invites further reflection on how early modern theories might illuminate contemporary questions of political obligation.",Luke Foster University of Chicago,Shasta Kaul University of Notre Dame,"Vitoria, Suarez and Las Casas on Just War, Natural Law and Political Obligation - Max Kuhelj Bugaric, Harvard University
